"no doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.bluetooth range not more than 10m2. pain in ear due the conical buds(can be removed)3. wires are a bit long which makes it odd in front.4. no pouch provided.5. worst part is very low quality and distoring mic. other person keeps complaining about my voice.

"received this boat 255 earphones yesterday evening.sound quality is perfect. good combination of bass and treble. can feel every beat.connectivity is quick. detects and connects easily.battery life is good. stayed around 10-11 hrs.as i received this yesterday evening. have been playing since then. so its just the first day review. but performance is good.earphones looks solid. build quality is good. the magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. earphones looks great.earphone wire could be bit long. but that's fine for me. not sure about others.didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.one thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.but overall performance was nice. good experience.

"the product is a good buy if you are looking for a decent bluetooth earphones with a reputed brand.sound quality 4/5)- pretty good with good amount of bass.durability (4/5)- the material seems durable and the earphones are light weightbattery life (3.5/5)- it has a decent battery life of upto 5-6 hours playtime on 80% volume.connectivity (3.5/5)- gets connected with seconds but sometimes gets disconnected within a small rangecall quality (3/5)- call quality is decent, the person on the other end of the call can here you clearly however you need to place the mic exactly near your mouth. sometimes the call gets distorted.

"below average product. not happy at all.pros : good sound qualitycons : very uncomfortable, silicon buds are not soft. bought a memory foam bud pair to use it.battery life is just ok. once give a low battery alarm, dies within 2 minlittle heavy on earsno return possible
";Neutral;-;-;-
"he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece and that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. and seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. i bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. my senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. so if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

"update: sadly this is the second boat product to conk off after few months of use. i guess this is the end of the journey for you and i boat audio, not buying any more products from your brand. changed the rating to reflect the same.i was in the market for a cheap pair of bluetooth earphones and i chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. i have used boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. i’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• the sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. if you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. the quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. i can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. but sometimes when i’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• battery life is nothing to write home about – i listen to music constantly even when i’m at work. my demands are probably too high for this price range.• it is sweat-proof as advertised. no interruptions under a light drizzle.• it’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. doesn’t tangle at all.• it stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.on the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. wait for a sale before you get it though.like my reviews? please do click the helpful button. it encourages me to share more about the products i use. thanks!

"the item has been rendered defective three times in less than two months of usage. the first two times was due to charging issue and the third time due to sound distortion. being under warranty, the item has been repaired the first two times and now i have registered a compliant for the third failure. the product has spent more time at the service centre than i have used it. am completely dissatisfied with the reliability of the product.
";-;-;-;-
"purchased it for 999. and the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. bass is still justified for its price. basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons. the startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. could have kept very subtle.and also battery drains out quickly. the microphone is the worst. the person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. the built quality is very cheap. dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.also when i used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. i had to abstain from using it during morning jog. after this experience am giving it only 2 stars.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"the reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.pros:>good noise cancellation>excellent sound quality>range is not bad>good battery lifecons:>the soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>durability: the left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. the company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>it does not inform when the bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. it keeps informing 'oops! battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

"got this for rs. 999. a great deal for the price.bought it socially for multipoint features.works great with 2 mobiles but i have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a windows 10 laptop. it may take a while to connect back with a windows 10 laptop.battery is okay. can't take it off the whole day.don't expect noise cancellation. sound is great. you can enjoy bass. another little annoying thing apart from connecting with windows laptop is the crackling sound which i can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.

"i had brought the piece after reading lot of reviews etc. when i purchased and started using it turned off and said battery low .. thats fine as initial product charged battery full and started using it ..it started reconnecting most of time and sound started disappearing . i checking the range on the manual which said 10m and i saw when i placed my mobile in shirts pocket it was perfect and working and when i moved it to pants pocket it disconnected and reconnected . and it kept happening with 100% charge and was totally waste of time and value for this .tried many times and got to know its very small range one and doesnt come with proper range.

"hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. i tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. as some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. if you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. the earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. noise cancellation is good.5. ear comfort is ok.if i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.this product should be in the range of 600 to 800 maxstill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from ali express

"let me tell you about the product in details,1. sound quality is good. it is harmless for ears. not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. battery backup 'was' awesome. six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingbut4. product is not charging after only two days of purchase. and it is not acceptable. that's why the rating is one (lesser than one is not available though)i will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.and one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.regardssiddharth

"it was priced around 2.7k initially. but i definitely know it doesn't worth it. i got it in an offer for rs.1.1k. still it is not worth the price. i was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and i started to develop ear/headache if i continue to listen more than 1 hr. definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. the string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. i have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. you cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.if you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like jbl, senheiser etc. if you want to cut cost, well this is the best among the other worsts in the market

"the wire from the band to the ears is too long. previously, i was using skull candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). skull candy wire length was perfect. in boats rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. the sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. so if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

"i have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. thanks amazon and seller for initiating the refund. i am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. my first lengthy review is below.pros:1. bass, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, double press invokes the last phone call . on the go call. so when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. so life of the earphone is assured.5. neck design if u like it.6. easy to connect. range/connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.cons:1. mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. so the other person on the call can't hear properly. mic picks up so many noise as no mems in this.2. bass is not everything in music. too much of bass. even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. battery life is mediocre when compared to others.i have bought mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.pros: dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, mic noiseless,cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.cheers!!!

"i’ve been using this for past few months now.at first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. during charging there’s no led indicator. so sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. the on/off switch is not ux friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing volume buttons or power button. all buttons are diamond shaped. extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. the bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. you have to switch on phone bluetooth and then the earphone. if you switch on the earphone and then the phone bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(i know it’s not the problem with iphone, because my previous bluetooth used to work this way) . this is very stupid. so you have to re-start the earphone.4. double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. occasional buzz or distortion. sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. on restart of the earphone it goes away.

"i have been using the headset for 2 months. the battery life is pathetic. it might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. the noise cancellation is avergae and the mic is the biggest let down. when i use this for calls when i am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. and the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. i won't recommend this to anyone. i read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. most reviews were rating it pretty high. so i have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!happy shopping!!

"cons:-these earphones does not tell remaining battery till it is very low. a button should be there to know battery life.-after battery gets low they don't last more then 6 mins or so. also voice assistant keeps shouting battery low. they become unusable.-more earbuds should be there. 3 sizes do not fit all.pros:- boat has best after sales support no other company comes close to them. repair and replacements are completely hassle free.

"i don't usually write reviews for products but i must do for this one to let people know about the issues i am facing. i will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*reliability:*the earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. it's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*experience:*the earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. but what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""oops, battery low"". this keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. if the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. but every time bugging is not a good experience.also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. you have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*sound quality:*the first song i listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. but it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*build quality:*build quality is really good. no issues with that.*battery life*satisfied with battery life. but it doesn't last that long as promised. but i am okay with that.

"i also own a bose premium headphones which i think i cannot wear everyday to gym, so i bought this product for my day to day workouts. comparing it with bose, sound is not that crisp but for a bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. i really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.full marks for that, but i find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. there is a u shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. the sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. if you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.i was mislead with the pictures, i thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)but if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.cheers.

"i read many good and bad reviews for this product and i brought it now i will review it honestly for who all are reading this review1.my product box is fully damage and reworked the box it's like some one used it but the product is fine.2.the sound clarity is good only for music with extraordinary bass in it but not for movie and youtube videos.3.noise cancellation is not good at all it's waste i still here background noise4.not a great fit for workout session because due to sweat it's run out of ear and the magnetic lock is not locking perfectly when we unplugged in ear5.its has a good battery life like there said solidly 5:30-6 hrs and it's charge time is 1:30hrsthat's it everything i about this earphones.

"i bought this product after a long wait for drop in price for 1500 finally but just after few days of buying it for 1500, the price further dropped to 999! really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! quality wise they're good but not exceptional. also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! i find it very inconvenient because my sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which i cannot fit on these as they fit lose.

"i had bought the earphones about 20 days back. they were working absolutely fine. they fit perfectly and sound great.but after 20 days of working they stopped working. they wont switch on. i tried charging with powerbanks, pc, chargers (i was very careful of not exceeding the amperage for charging and i didnt exceed the limit). now to claim warranty i have to send this to the company which will take at least 10-15 days. this is very unfortunate and i am seriously questioning the legitimacy of this brand.

"does the work for portable music listening. needs a quiet place for the mic to work, it isnt great and i never use it for calls. base is quite high and pains your ear after and hour of listening. if you get this around 1000 bucks, take it for a portable experience otherwise invest on a good wired in-ear sennheiser which u get below 1500 and gives the best audio output

"the pity is that everything about these earphones are great, starting from the sound quality, the technology/user-friendliness, and even the instructions. but i don't know which genius came up with the earbud designs. they hurt a lot! unless you insert them deep in your ears you won't really be able to get them to stay on. inevitably after about 15 minutes of usage, your ears will ache. therefore even though its a perfectly fine product in all other ways, its not very usable. a great pity.

"overall: decent product, not worth the cost.issues below are experience over 1 week of using the product on iphone 6.pros: sturdy material, flexible behind the neck strap and wire quality durable and tangle free. good battery life.cons: the device does not have good bluetooth connectivity. if your phone is more that one foot away from you, the sound gets cut off very often. for example, if you have your phone in your handbag/backpack/pocket, you can expect multiple cut offs, especially while moving (walking, using a scooter/motorcycle). if you move further away you need to be in direct sight of the phone for continuous music (if you turn your back to the phone or if there is any obstruction (not even a wall, a bathroom stall door is all it takes) the music gets cut off. not sure if it is just my piece but this is very frustrating.the ear pieces have magnets so that it connects around your neck when not in use, however this makes each ear piece heavier, as a result if you are using smaller in-ear buds, they tend to fall out due to the weight of the ear piece. this becomes a hassle while working out, particularly jogging/running.

"terrible sound quality. i don't have much idea about songs from the edm, pop genre but if you are one who's into rock/metal or the likes then stay as far away from this as possible. the sound clarity is terribly. lows can be lived with, the mids would make you hate your decision to buy, the highs would make you kill yourself. noise cancellation is satisfactory but nothing beyond that. charging never seemed a hassle to me and lasts a decent amount of time on battery. build quality is good however it's only been a week. in terms of comfort, never really had any issues despite running it for a continuous 2-3 hours once. buds are soft and fit in snugly. bluetooth connectivity is strong, however there are times when the connection stutters.and yes, it cannot be refunded,only replaced. so purchase wisely.

" bass is extremely good. no doubt. mic clarity is very poor, especially during outside. mic noise cancelation is not effective. ear buds are comfort enough and completely conceals the ears so during driving you should use only one side, otherwise you cannot hear the other vehicles horns etc., after usage for some long time of 1hr or so it pains in the ears. battery back up is 4 to 5hrs hardly. please be careful that once battery charge comes down to 20%, it switches off...bluetooth connectivity range is very short.

"in terms of sound quality, it is good. but this earphone is not for sports activity. the cable is quite heavy which will not let the earphone stick to your ear on heavy physical movement.range is not even 5 meters. as soon as you cross thredistance you start getting interruption.bluetooth quality is way poor that when you are walking listening music and have put your phone on your pocket, you start getting interruption.wire is way to long. around 2-3 inches extra, which looks weird if you are not putting it on and just kept it on neck. i have given the image. i am 5.4. the earphone is hanging 5 inches below my chest.overall, bearable for walking, but definitely not good if you want to buy this for jogging or exercise.

"this was a product suggested by many but with my comprehensive use of over two months i can say it's not a good product. the battery life on this thing is highly inconsistent even when i'm listening to music at same volume( it has happened quite a few times that i charge it to a 100 at night but it doesn't last more than an hour ). the second issue i want to point out is the bluetooth connectivity. this device connected in a blink for a month or so, but then it used to suddenly disconnect from my device. after a month i started facing issues connecting to the device, sometimes ( even with full battery ) the device was not discoverable. as a whole i would not recommend this pair of wireless earphones.

"hi,good sound quality at this price range. i am using it just recently and has already noticed that build is not so good, one of the biggest flaws actually. second problem i faced is that the wire is too long, hence lookwise it looks bit shabby and also it keeps calling from the ear. here again the earbuds design not so good to add it to the easily falling off from the ear. who likes it! apart from this boat always provides satisfactory listening experience at cheaper rates. i would love to see it working even after one year even after so many build flaws, after all if the product is rough and tough at affordable rates, all this flaws can be ignored.thanks!

"it says it can connect to two devices, but, it does not. you have to disconnect from first to connect to second. and then it takes too much time/tries to connect to the second one. it also lags if u connect it to laptop and watch netflix, if you jump 10 minutes ahead, the voice quality deteriorates heavily.sound quality is okayish. got it at 999, still returned it.

"not good as i thought. writing this review after using 3months. noise cancellation is not good. i purchased two headset of boat rockers 255. one of those set partially stopped working. called amazon customer service. waiting for replacement.

"i wanted something to replace my tomtom's bluetooth ear phones (ah, how i miss them). while the sound quality is way better then what i derived from tomtom's original set, but boat rockerz are heavy, bouncy and needs your attention all the time while running. the heavy arms are probably the reason for delivering the sound quality and longer battery life, but they surely are not for runners.
";Positive;-;-;-
"i received it yesterday, as i wanted a wireless earphones. quality of sound is just disappointing, so much of bass, it masks all the finer tunes. i am using sound magic e10c, which in terms of sound quality way ahead of this product. i purchased it in 1199/- in sale (these sales are just selling gimmick,i knew boat is just a branding on chinese stuffs like micromax, they can sell their item only on e plateform, still i thought to give it a try.

"i used this product for like 6 months. in between one side of its earphone stopped working but boat team is too responsive as they replaced this product with new one. sound quality is good but if you want better quality would recommend for other product. battery life is best even using for so much of time. but facing difficulties as there always some kind of issue happening again and again. other then its fine if it is bought under sale.

"if only this the bluetooth range was little better this would have been an excellent product.i use thus headphone while running. when i kept my phone on zipped pocket on the back of my track i would often loose connectivity. i had to keep my phone either on my hand or front pocket which was quite inconvenient. i returned the first one but still same problem withbthe second one.i also wish they’d provide a case for safekeeping.

"sound quality is good but there's lot of disturbance while playing music. sounds like music is buffering due to slow internet connection even though i am playing tracks which are saved in my phone. when they are saying it's has qualcomm technology for better connectivity then i don't expect this.another issue is battery drains too fast. if i charge fully in the morning then i need to charge in the afternoon coz it's switched off.i have given the 2 stars for the sound quality only otherwise it's not much worth.

"review after 4 months of usage.life of this product is of 3-4 months,its not durable or reliable.one side becomes non-functional.the after service is the worst from boat.there is no service center and there is no one to respond on callsyou may log a ticket with boat but there won't be any resolution for a month and no one will respond to your query.if you don't get frustrated with above things and are ready to pay more than 1000 bucks for this.. then god bless u

"connection issues is my main problem. phone is in pocket and sound breaks up. and lag is awful in pubg you stop walking and sound is like good second or two behind. amazing sound quality for price. comfortable built quality is not bad. that’s why i gave 3 stars. i am going to use it for music mainly so i am keeping it, but if you are planning to use it for gaming don’t but it. i wouldn’t recommend this. if you are using it for anything but music.

"if u think of some bad product's i've got. this is one of the top ones. got the new one which died a week after the return date passed. sent it for repair and got the replacement after 4 weeks which worked for less than a week. sent it back again and got it after 4 weeks which worked a little more this time and lasted for 3-4 weeks and the battery is gone again. the battery doesn't last for more than 30 min no matter what i do. charged it for a few mins and hours and neither made a difference

"rubbish , money waste, no noise cancellation, i purchased it keeping in mind abt so many positive reviews... i was so sure abt getting it but after a week or so, it started giving trouble.. 200rs mi earplugs are far faaaar better thn this. i wasted my money, you dont do it!! dont go by the reviews, i am shocked how it got too many p+ reviews

"pro's - packaging, easy wireless syncing with laptop/android, noise cancellation, battery. cons - extremely bloated bass which makes it hard to listen to music to, poor mic which attracts complaint of poor sound quality while using phone/skype. these headphones are useful for sports/workout only. not for serious music listening or any use which needs use of the mic.
";Negative;-;-;-
"the earphone is fine. the wire is way too long which is annoying during worouts. the wire at the neck is way too thick. seems like wearing a hairband around the neck. i do not like it for that reason. it will just keep shifting from one side to another and will distract you during workouts.dound quality is good. however, the bluetooth range is not so good. it starts to disconnectent while moving in the gym from one side another.
";Positive;-;-;-
"first things firstheadphone is very good...connenctivity is awesome...connects two devices simultaneously... if u r watching on one device and u receive a call on another then movie will get paused automatically...the only complaint is call quality... i had received almost 15 calls on the day when i used it for first time.. and almost all of them asked me to remove my headphones... bcoz they couldn't listen my voice properly....so consider this before.. overall ok..

"i was hoping for great bass which is not easily found in most low to medium budget headphones, but disappointed with it :-( sound clarity is excellent, but output is so sharp & piercing that it could damage your hearing if you do not remember to reduce the volume by at least 2 points before plugging in! over all, it is okay for the price but i already have an over-the-ear bluetooth headset from boat that i love and hence expected similar sound quality.

"sound quality is not crystal clear...on high volume it's very bad...the microphone is very bad actually that doesn't have noise cancellation...when ever i take a call when there is little disturbance...they other person is not able to listen my voice but he's able to listen all the disturbances.i literally hate this.even i replaced but the same problem that means this product is not well built

"the unit stopped charging within months of purchase. was replaced by boat in 10 days of complaint with a refurbished unit. the replacement provided was faulty with distortion of sound in one side and a 5 hour charge lasted for only 30 mins. had to raise another complaint. seems they don't do proper quality check before giving replacement. will update on this basis the experience of the second complaint raised.

"writing this review after one month usage.product is meant for people who prefer good bass. sound quality starts dropping once u move away from object let it be like 4-5 meters too initial it was better. as it takes into consideration your body deflection ,and sound of a person talking is like he is in water.battery life is good.sound quality is better as i grabbed it for discount at 1200/?.actually would give 3.5 ??

"pros: excellent sound quality for this price.. i would have not returned it, if it had continued to work well.cons : stopped working 15 days from the date of purchase. also, my phone had to be almost near the headphone for it to work well.
";Positive;-;-;-
"it's noise cancellation isn't very effective. u need to speak loudly for other party to hear your voice. also, battery goes straight from 100 to 80% and theb to 60% in no time. after this just gives 3-4 warning within 5minutes of play and it'll go off. 60% battery means, it should hold at least for 30-40 mins but it doesn't. good in terms of bass and sound quality. overall it's an average product with lots of advertisement and marketing.

"sound quality is not so good and not so bad, i'd say average. bass is good but not so strong with treble. but the main problem is the durability. in 3 months, battery started draining in an just an hour long usage and also phone calls stopped working. this is the second time i'm having a terrible experience with boat earphones, earlier with a different model. i'm really starting to think if they're worth it because of this durability concerns.

"it's slightly loose in case of fitting. if you move your neck continuously then it will come out from your ears. sound quality is too good. as expected from boat. the main issue is after sometimes of connection via bluetooth, the rockerz 255 disconnects automatically. don't why. except that it's a very decent earphone in case of sound quality.

"everything else is great but the major issue with this earphone is its very hard for ears and your ears will start paining within 30 mins of usage and i also tried all 3 earbuds which come from company but still the same issue. also there's no refund policy from boat only replacement will be given. so don't buy as i'm regretting my decision.

"i did not get the product . only empty box .

"overall its a good deal in the price given. i think the noise cancellation could have been better.also if you use continuously battery doesn't last more than 4 hours. at times it becomes irritating as despite having headphones you wait until you go back and charge it. did not help in long travelling hours. keep a wired headphones with you if don't want to be bored when the battery goes off.

"ok guyssound is 3 out of 5 only bass no serious good soundsound is not very high for pubgthe biggest problem is that i ise iphone and it beeps very much while increasing or decreasing volume, changing song playing paise even while dragging it , it feels very bad and it is very annoying . my honest advice is that it should’ve been not priced for more than 1000 rupees
";-;-;-;-
"overall its a good headset.. but it have some major drawbacks.. as a music lover i felt that the bass is good enough but the other things are a bit low. and while playing pubg and using voice chat it automatically reduces the surrounding sounds and i can't hear footsteps and gunshots clearly.. so i think these two are a major problem.

"good earphones for those who loves bass! but the drawback is that it doesn't have clear clarity of treble. it has less clarity and more bass! and so according to this feature the cost 1,699/- is bit more. but you get a good battery backup and good built quality.

"this is a typical ""let's make a fool out of indians"" product ... and i am a ""foolish indian.""here are a few facts about this product: it is made in china, like every other indian product is. and on the streets of shenzhen, you will find this product for less than inr 100. 150 tops. at that price, this would have been a 5 star product. but, at about inr 700 ... this is a pathetically low quality product that has not gone through quality control.let's see what all is wrong with the product: the biggest flaw is that these jokers have packaged two ear-plugs (or whatever they are called) for only one side of the headset. what do i mean? see the attached photo. those are two ear plugs that go over the right side of the headset! two!! putting it more clearly, there's no ear-plug for the left speaker on the headset!! why is that a problem? because the plastic material on the headset is so slippery that it is impossible for the headset to stay in your ears. putting it more clearly, without those rubber ear-plugs, the headset keeps slipping off my ear, and will possibly slip out of every other ordinary human being's ears!issue #2: the controller, where you have the on/off and volume control buttons is so heavy that, without the rubber paddings (ear plugs mentioned earlier) the headset keeps slipping off.issue #3: are you driving? are you jogging? are you in a typical indian public transport that rattles you to the last bone? nope! you can't use this headset, because it will keep slipping out of your ears.so, why didn't i return it? because:1. i am a typical indian who likes to be made a fool of by indian companies,2. i am lazy,3. i just didn't want to wait for amazon's pick up person to come ""anytime it suits him"" or call me and say that he will pick it up some other day at his convenience.overall, i lost inr 700 by being a typical indian fool who wants to use modern products and hopes, wishes and prays that some indian company will make them available to him ... and then spend his hard earned money to get such a product - but in stead gets just a plastic casing for that high price.bottom line: don't buy this piece of junk. i wasted my money, but you shouldn't!

";Negative;-;-;-
"i bought these a few days back and after a lot of thought. here's my impression:pros:1. sound quality - these bluetooth earphones are quite clear and crisp which i loved, however i find that on call and even in general the volume output is low so often you have to keep it on maximum which i don't think it's heathy at all.2. noise cancellation - these earphones have zero noise cancellation since they are not earbud style, so if you are in noisy traffic chances are you will struggle to hear music and the caller on the line3. bluetooth range - the range is good, you can get as far as one room away with no distortion nor disturbance which is very pleasant, i really liked that. however it struggles to stay connected should you travel any further than that. decent range, works for me4. built quality - the build quality is as can be expected for an earphone in the range but even then it's good, well finished and the flat cable really does help quite a bit to keep from a tangled mess!5. battery life - with medium usage it lasted me close to 1½ days on a single charge which is not shabby.cons:1. the design of the headset with the battery on the one side and the microphone unit on the other is very flawed because inadvertently if you are using only one earphone the battery unit pulls the microphone to the back of your head and you have to constantly adjust. it happens even when you wear both, either a neckband on the section that goes around or even a clip to tighten the wire on the back of the head would have been a good addition2. the earphones - i found that since these rest just inside the ear opening they need constant adjusting as they tend to shift as you are working or moving, plus my ears started hurting a little as some point, not to the extent of returning these or not keeping them in but i believe providing mini ear hooks would have been a good idea so that they keep the earphones snug and immobile
";Negative;-;-;-
"bought this 1 month back. very impressive sound quality and reasonable bass and noise cancellation as well. but lacking few important features. 1) no multipoint connection. you can pair to only one device at a time 2) no auto off (battery saving feature) when not in connection with any of your devices. it drains battery at the end of the day even if not connected! and not available to use (due to batter drain throughout the day) when you really want to use it. 3) no magnet in the backside of the earbuds. so, you need to take extra care when you hang them around your neck.i am unhappy with these drawbacks at this price because, my 1200rs bt earbuds is having these features built in. hence giving 3* even though i like the sound quality.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"first of all let me tell you the cons of this productcons:--> ergonomically poor design, the buds do not fit in ear they tend to slip off since it's metallic.--> since it's not a in ear type and metallic, you can't keep the buds more than 30min, you start getting pain.--> length of the cable is not as shown in the display images, it's lengthy and gets tangled.--> button quality is not up to the mark. ok ok--> battery life is poor. it does not even last for 4 hours.--> never expected jbl would do such poor engineering and did very bad ergonomic design for this product.--> since the bud size is small i thought i could use it while riding bike with my helmet on. but as i told it's so slippery, there is no way you can use it with your helmet on. i was very disappointed with all these points.pros:--> sound quality is good. no complaints on that.i would definitely not suggest this product to anyone. it's up to you all.

"the earphones don't fit my ears!within 2 hours of delivery, i called back amazon for a return. but they said return would only be done for a damaged product, so i've to ""live with it"" even if it doesn't fit my ears and i've to hold it with both my hands to keep it in place!moreover it's extremely uncomfortable as there is no rubber.sound quality seems decent but unfortunately they are so loose in my ears that i'm unable to judge it well. most of the sound goes out of my ears!the description said its metal earphones, but somehow it feels plastic, so i don't want to fondle with it too much.customer care said i could buy some ear clips so that they stay on my ears but i'm not able to find a correct match for it.

"1. you have to be on 100% volume in the mobile to hear some good sound in earphones.2. battery comes around 3-4hours.3. comfortable in the ear but wire size is uneven and a big minus. it is bit large than it supposed to be.4. sound quality is ok , not great and not very poor. i give 35 marks for sound quality.5. device quality is bit poor, attached a pic . in that you can observe how it is after 1 month.6. bluetooth range is also ok kind not more than 10feet. if you are in different room it is not connecting.finally compare to level u, this stays bit low in terms of sound quality and bluetooth range, but quality wise this is somewhat better than level u. because my level u got broken in the middle and bluetooth is connecting now. this earphones are idea for listening some stuff in youtube but not recommended for music lovers.

"didn't like the product earbuds, they are not at all comfortable. asked my few other friends to try it on, even they said not comfortable. starts paining in the ear after 20 mins of usage, which results into massive headache.also there's no return policy from amazon nor jbl as well.feels like both companies doesn't care about customer complaint.my suggestion would be to buy another model except this.

"one of the most uncomfortable headphones i tried.actually, i bought this from amazon with feeling that i can return if i didn't like the product (and i confirmed the same from one customer care executive). but, when i tried to raise return request it was denied. i told them it's uncomfortable to wear (maybe issue with my ear size), and there are no earpads using which i can wear it, but the so-called technical guy was not listening. he was just insisting that i should try the same and give us call on the last day for return (unfortunately i went out on tour during the same, so they are struck with me). regarding product, if it fits your ear fine i think you will love this product. if you have sensitive ears, a big no for you.
";-;-;-;-
"now that i've been using the product for about a month i'll discuss the pros and cons of the earphones in a detailed way.pros- sound quality is good. you can feel the kicks when it comes to hard hitting songs. sound has clarity and bass and treble is well balanced.cons- the earphones are not at all comfortable, they keep falling often and it really pains the ear for long working sessions. you cannot keep it in your ear for more than an hour or two. and regarding the sound, it gets distorted at high volume and also the bass gets lost. at mid-volume it's okay.and regarding the battery, it's really terrible. it's written that you can use it for six hours but i can hardly use it for four hours. the battery is really disturbing.the bluetooth connectivity isn't bad but it gets distorted over a small range. like if my phone is in the next room i can play the dock in the current room. but if your phone is in the next room you'll not be able to connect to these earphones from the current room.overall i would say it's okay if you are just buying it for leisure but if you're buying it for jogging or other workout sessions then go for other earphones. these one's are not usable for working out. the buds will keep falling. considering other reputed brands i'd say that these earphones are okay and not bad at this price range.

"recently i bought jbl tune205 bt. the quality of the sound is great and comfortable to use for long usage. the earbuds are same as iphone earphones. the reason for 3 stars is because it doesn't work with imo/viber/messenger voice calls. during the voice calls on these apps the sound comes through mobile speaker not the bluetooth earphones, but on regular mobile calls it works perfectly fine.

"for being priced at inr 2,199 (that is how much i got it at) it clearly lacks the jbl standard. i haven't yet tested the battery life or noise cancellation but i'm not concerned about them tbh. it's the sound which prompted me to buy these earpods and i'm very disappointed with the sound quality and had they been offered at even half the price i got it at, it still wouldn't have been a good deal.

"these pair of headphones were supplied by appario retail pvt. ltd. were far from original, they appeared to be of some cheap quality china plastic stuff forget the sound quality also the packing was cheap with no seal and stickers partly removed and replaced from the headphone, i was told they are not returnable so they placed a replacement order with a promise to deliver original product however this time it was much worse faded plastic colour forget metal also it does not have any magnetic effect as mentioned in the product description just fake and duplicate waste of time and money please do not buy until and unless it's genuine, the seller does not sell genuine stuff

"accepted more from jbl.not satisfied.good to listing music. sound quality awsome for music.but not satisfied with calling. to basic product not effective . no noise calling.you not able to call on road or traffic even while you drive bike at speed of 30km with the helmet.my main purpose to take a call when i busy with other activities.totally disappointed for calling and battery performance. i need to charge two times a day.
";Positive;-;-;-
"first of all i want to convey jbl to add to some quality in their products if they are charging such a high price for them. i want to share my honest observation and experience about my jbl bt.1. i bought this for the price of rs. 2199/- which is quite high in comparison to other bt devices containg same features2. noise cancellation is really poor that if i am outside somewhere the another caller is hardly able to understand the voice properly.3. i bought this device two months back from the very first day it gets disconnected from my mobile whenever any call come then i have to mannually connect it.4. now its microphone stopped working and the worst part is i deposited it to the jbl service center on 9th may 2019, they told me that they will take the time of 15days to replace the product even after waiting for more than 20 days i have not recieved any satisfactory answer from jbl customer support then what the hell the term warranty makes any sense.now they told me that they don't have the same product in the stock and they also don't know when it will be in stock.i am highly disappointed from the customer service from such a highly reputed brand jbl, in my opinion this is just a ordinary bt earphones with a tag of jbl and no quality features.i request jbl to look into the matter as soon as possible and arrange to replace my product.my service request no. is dl-e250519-25010
";-;Neutral;-;-
"one of the worst in so far i've used. disconnects automatically. to connect it back i've to off and on sometimes. totally disappointed.base is just enough. battery life isn't that great to 3.5-4hrs on max usage. can't use it for commute purposes. maybe just gym or jogging. little heavy on the weight side. so they'll drop pretty easily. need to take care of that too. totally dissatisfied. returned the product. ????

"i think worst bluetooth headphones i have ever owned .it's totally incompatible with oneplus cannot even speak on a call .sound is okay nothing great .battery life is bad i found it to give about 4 hours of useage.the way it fits into the ear is the worst of all .i don't recommend people buy this product.i'm on the verge of returning mine .

"this is an attempt by jbl to make a different earpod style but ends up with an average product. the build quality is good and the sound quality is better but it's not like the apple 3.5 mm earpods. i have been using apple earpods since last 4-5 years and i know their quality of sound and bass. on the other hand this jbl has got earplugs made up of rubber and plastic and a metal finish which is rather painful for ears.
";Positive;-;-;-
"i am using this earphones since 2 months therefore i am the right person to tell you about this earphones.so the pros and cons of this earphones are:-pros-1.jbl brand name2.good build qualitycons-1.low battery life i.e. 6 hours if you listen to song at a middle level volume.2.long time required for charging approx 2 hours3.noise cancellation is equal to zero4.this earphone hardly fit in any ear5.low sound6.only bass no trebel and midsconclusion:-there are other better options it's a no from my side

"until it was working, the product was great. in fact, the other two pieces of the same item i ordered for friends are working fine, but this particular piece stopped working after 2 weeks. it simply cannot be switched on. the ten-day replacement window has closed, so it is unlikely that the seller will make a replacement. given the fairly expensive model and a reliable brand, i am extremely disappointed with the product.

";Positive;-;-;-
"jbl t205bt is light weight, flexible and easy to carry. sound quality is good. bluetooth connects very fast. build quality is very good. but the design of earpiece is little different from ibuds, hence ot is quite uncomfortable for ears. bluetooth connection quality is not good for calls. sound cracks and breaks very often. battery is ok for normal daily use. ( about 3 and half hours of music play with whole day connection with mobile can be expected). biggest drawback is noise cancellation is terrible. you can not get good music in traffic or while riding.
";Positive;-;-;-
"for a product thats made for mobility, this pair of earphones just is absolutely not made for the gym. the built quality is tacky, plasticky. earphones are large and not in-ear so they slip out often. there's no clip or fastening mechanism to keep them attached or in-ear. worst of all, 10 days of use in profuse sweat and moisture has killed them. the bluetooth connectivity comes on and off whenever it pleases, rendering them totally useless. not at all worth the price.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"i bought them from amazon, ans they were okay, just average sounding earphones, but after a few days, left earpiece started giving me problem such as low sound or sometimes no sound at all. i tried resetting them but nothing worked, i tried replacing them and the window got expired, i called harman and they informed i need to send them to delhi so they can have a look and check them, for like 2k i had to go through so much trouble. although the delivery was on time as expected but things get worse when customer service is not good or helpful.

"headphones are excellent and sound quality is also good, but the only problem is that it is not very comfortable in ears. you cant use it continuously for more than 2hrs otherwise your ear will start paining.i did compare it to iphone's headphone, and the difference and the reason for pain in ears was that the buds of jbl headphones are bigger than that of iphone's. and that's why not at all comfortable in ears.now my ears are paining like hell and i had to see an ent doctor.
";Positive;-;-;-
"the sound quality and noise cancellation is good.battery does not seem to last for 6 hours of usage.after 10 days of purchase, the devices charging started giving problems. after several attempts it charged only till 70%.return period is over. the customer care number of harman company is always engaged.

"first of all before buying the product, read whether the product can be returned back or its exchangable. i lost my 2000 rs, since this product cannot be returned back. it's giving immense pain on the earside due to its shape. what's the use of sound or bass quality if i cannot use this product. please shop intelligently, amazon will continue to make money at your discomfort

not worth it. i had a samsung level u before this. i bought a new one just because i had the old one for 3yrs. i'm disappointed with the fitting. it doesn't have any other size buds. it doesn't fit well inside my ear. it feels like it'll fall off. doesn't though.the buttons look cheap.i would go to my level u anyday ;-;-;-;-

"the placement of the mic is too far down the cord which actually goes behind the collar and therefore my voice doesn't reach to the person on the other side. i have to bring the mic near to my mouth so that he can hear me. this actually fails the purpose of hands free since one hand gets engaged in holding the mic near to my mouth

"i was planning on buying these but fortunately, an office colleague of mine bought one and i got to try it.the fitting in the ear is just ok; it is definitely not painful but pops out as you indulge in some physical activity like running.the bluetooth connectivity also seems a bit off; the phone was in my pocket and it still gave that mushy noise sometimes.the biggest let down for me was the audio quality. the highs, lows and beats are just overhsadowed by uncontrolled bass. it feels like music being played in an empty hall. also, the volume is also not very impressive. definitely not worth the money.i currently use boat earphones which i bought for rs.500 and they are way better than these 2k ones.better go for mivi or boat.

"i have been using cx180 since almost 4 years. those earphones were of much better quality than the cx275s.the sound quality is ok, but the wires are too thin and feels very delicate. apart from the quality, i had hard time authenticating the earphones from sennheiser, as the qr code on the box doesn't work anymore and the customer care services over the call & mail are horrible. after wasting cumulatively 3 hours over the phone listening to your call is important to us, please hold the line and wasting 4 days, (including sat and sun) i had given up all the hopes and decided to send the product back to amazon. but still somehow i convinced myself to keep the earphones ( may be due to the positive amazon reviews and my experience with cx180.i just hope that i never get a chance to use their warranty services.

"i would have given 2 stars to the product has it not been for sennheiser's after sales support.the product build quality is not great and it developed wrinkles at multiple place with normal usage. the wire length got reduced drastically after the wire twisted from several places. even the music was not extraordinary but it was definitely decent.however, the mic and earphones were good if you compare it to other brands, just that it did not meet the high expectations one normally associates with sennheiser. one of the earpieces stopped working 5 months after purchase. but a big thanks to the best after sales support of sennheiser, the product was replaced in 5 minutes with no questions asked!kudos to sennheiser to have such a customer friendly attitude and have such warranty policies which are actually there to help customers and not bog them down with questions and procedures.i will buy sennheiser again despite this product being average given its cost because i am not afraid that my product might be faulty or develop a fault.verdict - buy this product for the decent sound with a great mic and the promise of sennheiser. audiophiles can look for other options!

"i recently bought a sennheiser cx213 earphone for just rs.699/- from flipkart ,over the years i have been buying headphones of different makes including bose & to my pleasant surprise the no frills 213 exceeded all my expectations.the sennheiser cx 275 s has a mic & comes with add-ons such as a nice leatherette pouch, two pairs of extra earbuds of diff sizes for better ear canal fit and a l cable adapter for rs.1648 on amazon but quality and performance wise cx213 is a much better product at less than half the price of cx 275 s.so if you don't mind the absence of a mic and want to just listen to music or watch videos go for cx213 hands down. quality of the wire in cx 213 is much better than that of the cx 275 s & longer too.
";Positive;-;-;-
"a decent pair of earphones, and pretty damn solid for the untrained ear. it's fairly loud, and a little heavier on the bass side which at times makes the audio a little murky, but for the most part, above average at this price range. the most disappointing feature about these earphones is the quality of the materials used to make it. nothing short of awful, it's very fragile and if not given extreme care will break. heck even the cheap ?300 mi earphones have better build quality than this. so, an absolute no go for rough users.i would recommend this to casual home listener's who can take care of their gear.

"pros:1) probably the best nice cancellation earphones at this price.2) you'll feel each and every nood seperately.3) great for those who don't like bass hevey garbages.4) carrying punch is of good quality.5) the music will not be distributed when your earphones cable collide with your clothes or hands ( hope you're getting what i'm trying to say)cons:1) low bass ( bid still that's more than enough for me)2) earphones are not tangle free.3) thin cable, so requires extra care(so it's not for kids and idiots)

"i think sennheiser has degraded the built quality of these pair of earphones i'm saying this on behalf of my personal experience because i have been using this earphones from 2015(from croma at rs 1600) and again i bought it in dec 2018 but from amazon at rs1585 (price in croma rs 1699 on dec.25.2018). i found the sound quality is still ok but they have degraded the built quality .

"my mother is pleased with these earphones. the sennheiser bag is very sleek and presentable.personally i found the audio to be okay-ish. the loudness is on the higher side and the bass seems to be excessive, overwhelming other sounds. it is not bad but it is lacking the signature sennheiser balance and quality.this may be a good fit for phones that come sans a 3.5 mm jack. audio over usb is low energy, and these loud earphones should even it out. my mother is using this with a le 2.
";-;-;-;-
"its best headphone with clear sound and amazing bass, although the effect of base is best while listening it in less noise. as it doesn’t have any noise isolation but still if it perfectly fit in ears the sound is least effect with considerable noise. that is, it’s great for general commute. its mike is also great with it position and recording quality makes it best for calling.although it’s not a deal breaker but like me do not expect much with l shaped extension adapter it only works with samsung or some selected device. and it is also mention on its cover.comparing it with sony mdr series (extra bass series) schneider headphone is way ahead in sound quality, although it depends on your taste but it like sony mdr series have special punch to bass slightly cutting other aspects like tone quality and treble. schneider (this model) have almost the same (or better bass) with even better quality of other sound, other than sound it’s also have superior in comfort and ergonomics.the only thing it lag is the build quality, in almost same price tag sony mdr series are ip68 and build to last till you are bored with it. while this headphone needs to be treated like a baby and the other trade off with schneider is lesser service centre in india.so, if you are planning for workout or training music then forget this try schneider’s higher sports model or try sony, skullcandy etc. but if you are music lover looking only for premium sound quality then it’s the best in this price range.

"i really don't like these. fit is bad, sound is just fine, almost no bass, call quality is worst and you feel like two big jhumkaas hanging from your ears. it's the worst choice i ever made in gadgets i guess.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"if i would have written a review in the initial days of usage of these earphones, it would have been an amazing review of the product. but after 6 months of usage, i observed a volume difference between the two ear buds. this is something that is damaging for the ear. no one would recommend using such a product. sennheiser should really look into the product's performance in longer term(more than 6 months). if the product is not able to deliver as promised after 6 months, then it should be mentioned in the product's description.

"after a month i am writing this review. the product looks like chines. no strength looks like something went wrong inside the headphone not working. whatever i totally not recommend to buy this product. same or less price you would get other company blutooth headsets.advise for a company : please improve the quality. don't cheat the people.

"bought it on may this year, now it's completely damaged from the inside even though it looks good from the outside. when the earphone is connected, it turns the volume up and down on it's own, plays or pauses the songs automatically and opens apps (especially google assistant) on it's own. i thought it was a virus at first but after thorough scanning with different anti- viruses with no signs, i realized that it was indeed my earphone that was actually messing around with my smartphone. also the sound quality was not worth right from the start (maybe i received a defective piece). it had more trebel and hardly any bass. even when i set my equaliser to bass boost, the bass quality was not that great. infact the cx180 i had before sounded better than this.
";Negative;-;-;-
"volume seems to be very poor and sound can be heard only after raising the volume at least 50%. i got it replaced with another piece but still having the same issue. also, this headphone doesn't have that punchy bass but clarity is very good and sound is crystal clear. so if you are a bass lover then may be its not a perfect choice for you.also, the mic is not that good and i have to keep it very near to my mouth then only the other person can hear me properly. i wanted a replacement with another brand but seems seller doesn't have that in policy.
";Positive;-;-;-
"i have been a audiophile from over a decade and purchased this as a replacement to a sennheiser earbud pair that i had purchased in amsterdam a couple of years ago. i became a fan of what i had earlier and thought sennheiser would have improved the model as this one was priced higher, but to my great disappointment... the grip is bad, cable is really cheap quality, noise isolation - almost nil and finally audio quality, less than average... i have bought a jbl for my daughter at half this price... would not recommend.

"regularly normal pop music plays good. without any enhancements.but, while playing done instrumental, and old rock, some guitar solos only sound from left side, and other vocals from right, takes a little bit of time till it gets equalised. & whatever i do it won't get fixed.wire quality is very flimsy, might break any moment.worthless for ?1400not at all recommended.

"i am looking for a replacement of the product, within six /6 months, a piece broke of the mouth where you attach it to the phone & stayed stuck inside it so that i couldn't put or use any other earpiece even in place of your seinheiser one for long time till i could take it to a repair hub where they removed it, but as it is broken, can't use it anymore, how is this possible that a high-end claimed to be high quality earpiece costing about 1500 bucks breaks within few months? please arrange for a replacement asap immediately without fail from the company's side.
";Neutral;-;-;Neutral
"the product quality is not that good. wire seams to be very cheap. even after the discount not worth the price.. very low bass.. even low cost earphones have rich bass.. we can increase the bass by using equilizer but even though with equilizer the experience improved very slightly and also after using equalizer the voice losses it's originality. will not recommend it if one is hoping for rich bass with quality earphone. used jbl c100si (wired) and boat - rs. 1500 (bluetooth) both were way better then this. avoid buying unless one is die hard sennheiser fan..

"got to say, not impressed.sound profile is wide ,and the bass is spot on. does not overpower vocals . but yet there is something missing idk what. the stereo effect is less.i compared it with my onemore piston fit and boat basshead 220 . it is better than both. but i've heard a lot of sony xb55 and one of the youtuber suggested it over the 275 .be aware cause there is no refund after you buy it . there is only replacement . so make a wise decision and buy sony xb55 ap instead.

"i like to think of myself as an audiophile, and trust me i have tried numerous earphones, but by far these are my worst pick.the audio quality is terrible, it's super flat. as much as you are tempted to buy them, don't!even audio technical clr100 & jbl c150 si sounds mcuh better than these.i extremely regret buying these
";Negative;-;-;-
"the major issue with this iem is the build quality. the wire is so thin, it's almost on the verge of being invisible. the plastic used for mid and earset doesn't give any assurance either. the sound compared to other recent earphones in the same price segment is at best passable. the bass isn't rich, the music doesn't feel lively, although vocals seems fine.the right-side earphone stopped working after a year and a half, no doubt due the higher probability of wear and tear with this set.skip this, and go for byron's or sound magic e 11 c
";Neutral;-;-;-
"1. build quality is not the finest. you cannot expect such a low build quality from a rs1400 earphones(price at the time when i bought it) from a brand like sennheiser. specially the wire is too thin.2. sound quality is great , just what you expect from sennheiser. bass is punchier. you can get a little bit of cracking in sound above 85%3. definitely not a value for money product if you are seeking for good durable earphones
";Positive;-;-;-
"it's light weight, and sound quality is descent. only thing what i don't like is it's not durable. the wire with connector jack is fragile. you need to always take extra care. personally i always like the ones which has right angle with connector jack which protects most of the time.
";Neutral;-;-;-
it has great sound quality. no doubt in that. but the hardware part especially cables are so thin that a normal usage would tear them at the joints.i used it while running and in gym. the cable are almost torn.it is a great headphone to be used at one place such as office desk.overall, go for it, if you want to have a static use of it.##update: it has been a year now. one ear bud isnt working.i am probably gonna buy it again. ;Positive;-;-;-
"it sounds normal in samsung note5 (its performance is only equal to the performance of earphones came with note4). in other devices such as xperia z3, lenovo vibe x3, etc, its not that good, except rich bass sound. its performance doesn't justify its cost.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"quality of sound is not as good as sony xb55 or even samsung's inbox in-earphones. as volume is levelled up above 70% sound quality starts getting rediculous. cable quality is unacceptable. it is quiet easy to get damged. at this price consumer should not focus on brand name rather focus on quality of sound. moreover, it doesn't not have volume rockers keys.

"i ordered this item ""sennheiser cx275 s in-ear universal mobile headphone with mic (black)"" hoping it would give a better output than my current earphone ""sennheiser cx180"" but i was disappointed. the wire was too thin and delicate. the sound output was only 5 to 10 % better than cx180. i decided to return it.

"i don't know why this product got that much good reviews, i listen for 1 or 2 hours with all the kind of sounds and finally i got to know that at this cost we can get 2 earphones with better sound. this earphone has very bad sound quality like some local product that we can get in trains of cost 50 to 100 rs only. i really disappointed with this product.i was using sony c300 bluetooth earphone, if someone want to listen good sound just try that and compare, you will got to know.
";Positive;-;-;-
"the quality of sound is great, the design is also good; light weight but the wires are very thin and gets entangled and not recommended for rough use. one of the ear phone got damaged (suddenly no sound) even when from outside everything looked ok.price is also too high. sennheiser being such a reputed brand must look into its durability aspects; as its not a fair purchase spending rs. 1900 for the use of just 8 months. next time i would not purchase it as market offers branded products at 1/4th, 1/5th the price
";Neutral;Positive;-;-
"pls do not buy this product.sound is honestly good and clear, though bass is not as per expectations.product material quality is not good at all. i read some reviews around the quality, however i thought it is to do with user handling. but when i experienced it myself, i regret buying this product. it is a very delicate, which is unexpected for headphone kind of product. and this happens within 2 months of purchase

"product cost is more. this product is not value for money for the price which we pay. the quality of the wire also looks substandard. once if the wire gets damaged we have to keep running for warranty to hear unnecessary comments. instead its better to go to boat 225 hands free and its half the price of the senehiser cs-275 s. one can cooly get more than what you pay for boat 225 in-ear hands free.

"sound quality wise these earphones do their job 5? excellent.i am giving 3? because of1) the wires are very very thin2) there should be some ruf-n-tuf joint at all 3 points (at earpieces and jack)3) volume up and down keys are not there. if you are listening to music you have to take mobile out of your pocket everytime you want to adjust volume.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"i've used sennheiser before. this has more than decent sound quality. but the biggest turn off is that it doesn't come with volume control on wire. only one button is provided that connects/disconnect the call and plays/pause music. for controlling volume you'll need to take out the phone every single time. that's a big let off for me.
";Neutral;-;-;Neutral
"i'm a little confused over which side goes in which ear, as there's no marking for l and r. the output is nice, but has to be pushed inside the ear a little more than normal earphones to get the proper bass output and quality of sound.

"i have bought the earphone and faced issue of mirophone. even after replacing the earphone facing the same issue. it looks like this is default problem in all the headsets maybe manufacturing defect. please provide feedback to company. there is a delay in changing tracks using microphone button. also, the earphones do not work while answering the calls for the first time. it works while answering the call second time.

"the wire is too thin. so if you live in a place like mumbai and you travel in trains a lot, this headphones might rip easily. sound quality is great for price. bass is heavy and feels the right amount. the problem i faced with my oneplus 5 is that the headphone connector is too big for the 3.5mm jack. due to which, it keeps on poping out and getting disconnected within a few seconds of putting in.

"great set of earphones. the sound quality is beautiful. unfortunately, sennheiser has compromised on the build quality of the earphones. a few months down the line, one side has stopped working. the 3.5mm plug in is really flimsy and the wire is poor. you pay a lot of money and end up with poor quality. it's disappointing. the sound, however, is wonderful. if only the build quality was better.

"the headphones worked for a year without a glitch, but almost a year later, the console became gummy and sticky, i used these headphones only while traveling in public transits(bus). the console cover got completely spoiled and came off the headphones totally leaving the inner circuit open, after that within a day or two headphones died completely. now they are just a piece of dead garbage, doesn't even charge or get turned on.skull candy provides 2 years warranty all across the world except india.wow.... it's just a year of warranty u get in india and upon calling they told me that skullcandy headphones cant be fixed in any other way and i have to buy a new one. this wasn't expected from skullcandy, i am hugely disappointed with the product, my 3700 bucks are wasted. i would recommend not to purchase this garbage as it works only for a year.
";-;-;-;-
"got delivery on time. do not compare this earphone with wire earphone. as this is bluetooth based wireless earphones it compresses the sound quality hence we don't get amazing sound quality as wired. i have compared this earphone with sony sbh70 which is costlier then this but same result. so i will recommend this earphone at this cost the bass is good not amazing but mid range is amazing try listening song with 320kbps bit rate mp3 songs. only disadvantage is you will not get the sound quality like wired one. although it's best earphone at this price. listen song just by tweaking equaliser you won't be disappoint.

"the controls stopped working within 3 months of use!!!! after using for 10 minutes, they get disconnected automatically and the you have to charge them again to use and have to connect to a power supply to switch on the earbuds!!!!! bad quality. they ate under warranty but you have to send the earphone to noida at a cost of rs. 400+ , which you have to bear. even my skullcandy method stopped working but a bit later after using it for 10 months. got a replacement but they too have stopped working after 15 days of use!!!!!do not buy skullcandy earphones, better buy sennheiser momentum wired for rs. 4.5-5k. quality is much better.

"1. sound management is bad. sometimes the headphones are controlled separately by the haptic buttons on it, sometimes by the phone, so if a loud song comes along, it doesn't respond to the phone controls.2. the headphones are not heavy enough to stay on your shoulders while running and that makes it difficult to use them while running.3. decent sound quality and battery management4. okay for average use.

"listening to your neighbours blasting bhajan sangeet is a better wireless music experience than buying jbl. i hope god forgives these souls for making these earphones, because i know i can't. i am a jbl fan. i use a lot of their products like their sound bar, flip 4, wired earphones etc. they're all of wonderful quality and excellent durability. i saw that these didn't have a good rating on amazon, but still bought them because i trusted jbl. but as it turns out these are equivalent to cattle - excrement. i've never been so disappointed in something before. i absolutely hated the sound. i thought i'll give it another day and voila, the earphones have the craftsmenship of a toddler's craft from pottery class. the earpiece was coming apart, not to mention how difficult it was to keep them in my ear without falling. don't buy it. you sure deserve better. i'd wish this whole experience only on the worst of my enemies.

"i purchased this product a month ago & before to complete its first month, one of the ear-bud stopped working .this was never expected from a brand like jbl !! amazon return policy gets over within 10 days but then to search for jbl service center is a very painful task.jbl has a single service center in each city, so very bad 'after-sale-service' !! (if you are not lucky)even after visiting the service center, you are asked to submit your defective product & to come-back after 15days to get your product !!

";-;-;-;-
"was a big fan of jbl untill i received this product. the sound was not upto the mark. the voice on calls was pathetic as the reciever was hearing loud noises other than my voice. bass was not proper. better to go with a wired earphone instead of buying this. it was looking so big on neck and was not manageable for runs and workout. immidiately ordered return and amazon took lot many days to first return it and i am stil waiting for my money to be processed so that i can order a different earphone.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"third class product and can't contact jbl customer support through call or email. headphones battery doesn't hould charging even after charging overnight and it drains in few minutes feels like amazon is good at selling cheap products nor jbl or amazon is ready to take responsibility.
";-;-;-;-
"this is my personal experience with this product.i own jbl stuff at home.. but this device just doesn't belong to that category! weird. really disappointed by the quality. the audio quality doesn't sound like a genuine jbl make.. with very cheap base and slightly high treble.. it's not a pleasant product to enjoy music with.. sounds like the chinese made ?150 earphones.. i bought this product once and had it returned.. but then there was no available option for a refund. the customer service executive asked me to have the product replaced and check the product quality as the one i recieved might have been damaged for some reason. i agreed and after 3 days i received my product today and it's a new one but now i realise the product quality.. the problems i mentioned earlier still persist. there was no defects in the earlier one either.. and now i return it again and i see a refund option.. but then initially i used my visa card to pay.. and now the refund would only credit into my amazon pay balance and not my bank account. amazon wants me to spend that money on buying products from amazon itself n wouldn't refund it to me. anyways that shouldn't matter me as im a frequent user of the amazon pay balance. but who knows it might be a matter of fact to other people using amazon out there. that's again pretty disappointing. totally unsatisfied with the seller and the product.ps : i tried this product on the one plus 5t, samsung galaxy s9+ and also on an iphone 7+ and it was all the same.
";Positive;-;-;-
there is a serious pairing issues with this headset. i was facing this issue for quite some time that while talking on call headset pairing breaks with my phone. i have tried it with other phone as well thinking it could be a device specific intermittent issue but story remained unchanged. additionally, i have testify it another friend of mine who recently purchase it and he stamped on this issue.would want to return it but my returning duration is lapsed. i am stuck with this faulty piece. have bought on a higher price than portronics (becuase of brand image, jbl) but regretting now. ;-;Neutral;-;-
"terrible bass. this product does not justify the name given to it. i bought a portronics por-766 conch 204 along with this set, just as a spare, cost me some 400 or something which has a better output than the jbl. i wouldn't reccommend this product if you want to listen to music.i cannot believe i fell for this brand and model name like this. i wish i hadn't bought the product.
";-;-;-;-
"pros: crisp sound. good bass. good volume range.cons: works smoothly for the first month or two. post that you realise that there are connection issues due to minor obstructions like fabric or even if device is obstructed by a body part (neck or hand), so the sound falters. initially i could keep my mobile in my trouser pocket and listen to the music, but later on there was so much of connection stability issues, i had to hold it in my hand or keep it in direct, unobstructed range from the device. you can also see a drastic dip in the range between device and the headset over a period of time.eventually, it pretty much becomes as good as a regular earphone, because of the way and distance you have to place your device from you phone or laptop.i had to replace it after 4 months (it was in it warranty period). the condition of the replaced product is the same now. might get it changed again, i think, because its still in the warranty period. the good part about their service centre is that they replace it without asking questions, as long as you have the valid invoice with you.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"they sell calling it pure bass.. extra bass earphone..which it is surely not.. even jbl equalizer app isn't recognizing it.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"calling....is good but...for music there is no bass system...it run like a normal headset after paying 2k plus....so needs to improove music quality... besides all fine...
";-;-;-;-
"it stopped after a month of working.cahrging stopped. warrenty is not supported from the amazon you have to rush to the jbl service center to get replace. sound qualityis good but not great. just a ordinary headphones at the such cost.
";-;-;-;-
"i don't need to talk about the quality of the product...duh!, it's jbl, so obviously the sound quality and bass are awesome and upto the expectations. the only problem (s) i faced were that it's wire is way too long for a bluetooth device. sometimes it creates problems. on top of that, the right side earpiece stopped working after just 1 month of use. since it was under warranty i ordered for an exchange.

"sound quality is poor. no bass, not much treble. if you have used better headphones in the past, it will sound like you are listening music in speech mode. its flat. . sony mdr-ex150ap which is like the cheapest sony headphone with mic is light years ahead w.r.t to sound quality.buy this only if you are desperate for a bluetooth headphone.

"it comes with medium ear buds default.not good for bass lovers, although jbl says it's pure bass. not pure or extra bass. when pressed with hands tightly, we can feel some bass.sony extra bass lovers not buy this product.treble is bit more even the equilizer is adjusted.jbl : hear the truth, their tag line.that is true for every jbl product.i think i'll love this headset gradually.some adjustments are made. first replace medium ear bud with small size bud. it places tightly in the ear. thus feel more bass

my 2nd purchase. the 1st one only lasted for 1.5 months. checked with seller and they insisted that it comes with 1-month warranty only, so offered me 50% off to buy again. that says very much about the product quality. sound quality is exceptional for the price, but the product does not last long.;Neutral;Neutral;-;-

"i can’t get enough of this earphone! the bass is amazing and is perfect for a music lover. the battery life is good enough to keep me going all day. the fact that i can connect my laptop and phone at the same time and switch between them makes the experience so much better. i use my earphones a lot for voice calls and this doesn’t let me down at all. this is a must buy for all music lovers.

"hey all, i have used quite a few budget earphones, senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, jbl t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. additionally i have a philips basic, a sony and a jbl headphone. i have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. none of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. i'm obviously not an audiophile but i know the difference between a good sound and noise. the only concern i found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). cant fault it otherwise. i have it paired with rn5 pro.

"the product is great intially !but the real test is after 2 months of useso reviewing the product after two months of usepros1 the earphones drives you a very rich sound quality inspite of being wireless2 the neck band makes it much more durable then the other earphones3 the flat wire is very durable and the magnets saves it from you loosing it4 the 45 degree tilted earbuds just fits right in most of the ears (you can check with other 45 degree tilted earphones for a day that weather you are comfortable with it or not )5 it comes with 2 pairs of extra buds the small and big while the medium one is already on itcons1 - the connectivity of dual phones is not that easy as shown.(>connect the earphone to phone a as usual>disconnect it from the phone a by switching off the bluetooth on phone a>now connect the earphone to phone b>switch off the earphone and switch it on back>open the bluetooth settings on phone a and b>from the paired device list select boat rockers 255 on both the device at the same time.on the earphones you will get to hear you are now connected to boat rockerz 255 twice )2- you get a cracking sound when ideal or just before you dial a number on dial pad3 - battery life is not accuratesometimes it work hours with 40-60 % battery while sometime it is dead on 80%so dont rely on the battery indicator at all but the battery once charged for 2-3 hours works constantly for 5-6 hours on normal volume.i hope this was of some help do mark it helpful if so...overall you should go for it when you get a exciting deal on this product

"i just brought it in last week, and to be very frank,it's really awesome. beyond my expectations.sound quality is like having your own personal home theatre,too clear and loud enough, you can listen every single bit of music.and coming to battery backup, they said it's 6hrs but it's more than that, for me it's working near about one and more.i will say,go for it.

"i am a prime customer of amazon and i always purchase a product after so much research bought these boat rokerz in the sale in 1099 and trust me i am blown away by these i have used sony and other headphones in the price range of 5 & 6k but this is just similar to them in this price range ""sound quality"" 10/10 ""battery life"" seems good not tested for as described but will update soon ""durability"" 10/10 perfect fit no pain no discomfort.... really boat has done a fantastic job with amazing music quality with superb bass in all highs mids &lows ..... just go for it.

"awesome bass. this is even at low volume. so if bass is your thing these are the earphones for you. really like the sound. there could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.great battery life as well. lasts about 5-6 hours.the only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. i changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. maybe just takes getting used to.spent 999 for it on the great indian sale. definitely worth it.
";Negative;-;-;-
"audio quality is pretty good and the way it speaks bye amigos when turning it off is also unique.it's durable and designed right.it has mic opening towards down and engraved and rest of the headphone is completely covered,which makes it water resistant i guess.only things is that it looks weird when you leav it hanging around the neck unlike some other bluetooth headphones which have hard collar kind thing and then a wire stretching out of it. as it hangs too low from neck and the those hard collar kind ones look like small neck accessory when left hanging.either way i liked the product and it does the job. battery back is also really good.
";Positive;-;-;-
"close your eyes and just go for it. it is amazing at its price. i have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. there is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. the bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. the sound is crystal clear. mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. noise cancellation is pretty enough. i am very impressed from these earphones. and at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. really i love boat.
";Positive;-;-;-
"its grear earphones. i was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. you hardly feel it in your ears. mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

"i got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 pm. immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it amazon's insulated cover with invoice. opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.pros:1. connecting to my new oneplust 6t within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""you are now connected to boat rocerz 255""2. base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. music is so good to listen while driving.cons:1. multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where i could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. noise cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. if we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againoverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. as this is my second product from boat i strongly recommend this.

"product design is good and very durable. the best feature is the sound quality and its design. however what i didn't liked is the battery backup. its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. overall i would say , its a good deal only if its under 1k or max 1.2k inr.. otherwise i wont recommend it.

"pros:charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous)two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs,in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type).using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).lightwight,good build quality.i replaced rubber earplugs with piston earphone plugs, the 3 pairs comes with package are not too soft but are fine.you can control volume of pc and mobile depends on which device is currently playing.i am using piston onemore ,music quality is not to that level but is pretty decent. bass is balancedcons:range is 10m in real world plays well if u are in room , the moment you walk out of room then distortion occurs.mic is very sensitive and works fine so far no complains from other end. i have not used outside the room.when it keep it for charging it gets switch off on it own then have to reconnect it again (not a big issue) ....first i had doubt on it battery,sound quality,mic quality but after using it i am happy even though i have used one more ,boat 255,mi earphone 399 , samsung earphone, phillips 249 etc.

"i got it for inr999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. for casual listeners , it has decent sound . i found it very clear not comparable to hi-res earphones (ofcourse). it has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. but it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. connectivity is ok . not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the connection gets lost. moreover , since it's a bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. build quality seems good but only time can tell that. i have another boat product called boat rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. i have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. and if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as boat or tagg etc. so i believe they should sound very similar. and the mrp written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. there's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than inr1500.and now for "" audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. so that's it . happy shopping.

"nice product. i love it's sound and bass. i purchased for me and another two for my family members after i make sure for it's sound quality. but one thing i really concerned here about it build quality. mine replaced for two times till now for it's power button issue. it will take 20 days to replace the product. first time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. now they clame this new replacement is a good one. let's see how many days it will again goes.

"well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says ipx4 but my earphone box says ipx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , magnet lock , design .con - cable is a bit long. as it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.above all its a good product. recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone.

"really like the base and sound quality for this price. it's good to listen to music. i have a bose 300 qc but i'm using this on a day to day basis as carrying qc wherever i go is not practical. i going this headphone is quite enough for my music need . the microphone is working as expected.the only issue is that the headphone doesnt announce the battery percentage. however my oneplus 6t shows headphone battery when connected. the headphone give the annoying message ""battery is low"" from 20% onwards.

"just got this and i must say that the build quality is great. coming to the sound it has really good bass. can't comment of the battery yet as i just got it. i will update the review later after checking the battery backup.edit: so, after using it for few days, the battery easily lasts for a day and half a per my usage which includes 1-1.5 hrs of music, one movie (1.5-2hrs) and one episode of tv series (40-50mins). i end a with 40% battery left as per above usage.

"i bought these earphones on 23 march. my experience with these headphones is quite great. i got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. so talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. bass is good enough to make your toes move. mic is of good quality, noise cancellation could have been even better but i think thats great for this price range. works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. battery backup is good. though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. buttons are working well. build quality is superb. in short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.

"in terms of price range it is a good earphone but not the best one. sound quality is good, no issues with battery life and also feels very comfortable around your neck. sometimes the connection was breaking while you are travelling by vehicle but it is not a big issue as it happens rarely. the only thing that i did not liked was the length of cable. it was really a bit long that can make some disturbance to you especially when you are not listening to music and casually hangs it from your neck. however the magnetic effect was working very fine.

"worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 kjust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and csr 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. the seller is selling us version 4.1. please amazon correct it!! customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksi personally liked it.. bass is really good no noise while hearing. if you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..i use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.battery is ok i am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by boat. but no worries...

"can't compare with sony or any other branded ones. but in this price it's good. silicon material good to wear no feeling of like we are carrying it on our neck . its comfortable having it around the neck due to good silicon material. as this is in ear canal type speakers we. eed to really push it inside the canal 1st 1/3.then only we can enjoy real beats and bass. if you wear it superficially sound won't look great. so far battery , durability,sound ,price this is best one.

"boat rockerz bt headphone.1. product quality is decent. sound quality is good. works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. you will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to bluetooth, switch off etc. that is a good feature.3. placement of the earpiece is problematic. i found it difficult to place it initially, but i figured it out later. now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because i have been placing them in ear. so that's a bad thing.4. i noticed that the headset attracts a lot of dust when used. so on the black headset, you can see dust particles sticking on.

"honestly first bummer was packaging.it looks like it was already opened.the package got little torn.. tape looks off the place. also, earphones inside also didn't looked like fresh packaging. it really looks like it was used before.but i could be wrong and it could be just bad packaging also.sound is good though , average loud, but not very good. range is good i can easily use it while moving in my house. you will always feel some disturbance while playing.also, i tried connecting with multiple devices but it can not be done while it's connected to other device. first, you gotta disconnect it then it can be connected.

"just unpacked and pairing was very easy. i was able to pair this to my oneplus 5t and laptop. after pairing my phone first, i switched off the bluetooh in phone and paired with my pc. then switched on the bluetooth in phone. played music from pc and when i received a call in my phone, the headset goes silent and the music automatically pauses. exactly the way i wanted. however, one drawback is that when the phone call ends, the music doesnt resume automatically.sound quality is good.good bass.comfortable to wear

"this is a good buy. sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)sound quality - good with android. with iphone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. no complains on flat sound.wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.my only issue with this and other bt earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. if i keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and i have to reposition the neckband. this has happened quite a number of times. i used to own a tagg inferno and mivi thunderbeats, both had this issue and this one too.to summarise, worth buying, if under 1500.

"i am really glad of having this product. the previous one from boat was boat rockerz 400 whose sound quality with bass was just fabulous but call quality dissapointed me but this one really is excellent... i think i made the right choice of having this great product. really awsome product with best call quality , best durability, an excellent sound quality and a decent battery backup. what else one need from a product ranging around 1-1.5 k.. really i just loved it

"<pros>* rich bass* good built quality* magnetic lock* nice grip over neck*good company service (had to replace it because of faulty charging)<cons/>*dont leave the charging cap open because sweat can get in through it and damage the charging...*detailed review*boat rockerz 255 bluetooth in-ear headset is a very good quality product. it has a very rich bass and nooce cancellation is also pretty good. accessories like ear buds of different sizes and charging cable are provided. if you workout and sweat alot then make sure to keep tha charging cap closed because if sweat goes through it then it may damage the charging, the charging stopped working after 2 weeks so i had to replace it..and the company service was amazing it took around 10 days and then i got a replaced piece back with extra accessories..*conclusion*i would really recomend this, this headset provide a very good value for money.ps- just dont walk while using it..because the noice cancellation will not let u hear anything else and it may cause an accident..

"i love these earphones.my battery lasted from morning 6:40 am to 11pm where it was continuously connected to my smartphone. i used it for calls and for1 hour for music in this time period.there's a lot of bass. this can be levelled with your smart phone's inbuilt equalizer, but it will be a pain if you are using multiple music players or video players.the build quality is good w.r.t. the price. i bought it for rs. 1399/-.bluetooth pairing is very fast. no hazzles.it can be used for all activities but not voice recording. so if anyone is looking out for recording audio with this device then this is not at all what you are looking for.

"eventhough it connects two divices at the same time, however audio doesn't switch to the first device connected. while playing the audio from the first device connected, it doesn't work. only it works for last device connected. we need to reconnect the previous device to get it works.not sure manufacturing defect or functionality limitation. atleast it works flawlessly for other bluetooth headset like jabra.anyway it's light weight and sound quality is better than many other product of same price range

"i feel they are the best in the business. they have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. awesome accoustic experience is what boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the bose of their price point. i have been using boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. the battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. the 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.the wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.i am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. my brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.everyone should give them a try once.i had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. the boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.

"great headset for music lovers. solid bass, loud volumes and volume control separate for the headset in addition to mobile volume control which is a huge plus. good sound quality on audio calls. did not try while jogging, so unabl to review the moisture wicking properties much. good length to the earphone cable and good battery life. i purchased it for 949 inr and h nice good vfm. overall i would buy again.design wise, i like the boult wireless better than this as the wire tends to hang long down your neck when you are not using the earphones otherwise a great product to buy!

"i have been using boat wireless headphones since two years they have never disappointed me.this is my 3rs boat wireless headphones but i must say this one impressed me alot according to the price segment (rs 999),it's doing a perfect job of delivering good quality of sound.regarding the battery life its is 6hrs, but its quite ok since i have purchased it for 999rs only i can't expect much from it.coming to sound quality it has a bit more bass, the bass is more than treble but not a problem for those who love high bass.overall sound quality is more than good in this price segment.the build quality is not that high quality but yes it is sturdy enough to withstand normal drops.acording to me the length of cord is too lengthy.one thing i dint like about boaat is connectivity range, the range of connectivity for this is less than 10m,but again budget matters. given a thought i had paid only 999rs,i am very much satisfied with overall performanceregarding service center, the customers leaving in mumbai has added advantage as i had.my previous boat rockerz 275 one earpieces suddenly stopped so i visited the service center in goregaon and they replaced my headphones with new in just 5 minutes without any questions asked.so customers in mumbai don't worry about the warranty.

"one of the best boat earphones. i have been using boat for two years and i found their services to be very very impressive. the audio quality is very good. the music feels amazing. bass is also good compared to other boat products.however, one problem is that there is latency in audio while you are playing a game. i played pubg using these earphones and there was a mismatch between audio and the action performed in the game. if you are a gaming freak and plays a lot of game such as pubg, asphalt, cod, or any other game where audio is everything then don't buy bluetooth devices. go for wired one, they will perform far better. hope you will find this review helpful!

"above expectation, excellent sound quality and the battery life is just incredible, one charge easily lasts you around mote than 5 days with normal uses (only music while traveling) and 6-8 hrs in one go if you using it continuously. the durability is nice and the magnetic feature really comes handy when not in use. light weight very negligible weight and not noticeable when around neck, but sometimes this may result of loosing it and not suitable for bike ride (if riding at high speed).

"build: well designed, lightweight and comfortable. the wires are good and not flimsy, wearing comfort is well maintained, better than mi bluetooth earphones( the main competitor of boat in the 1499 price category).comfort: as mentioned above, these earphones are really comfortable, fits in the ear with no chance of slipping out (unless you're trying desperately and internationally). they're lightweight, so no hazard on that department. perfect for long hours of music playback.sound: the most important aspect of an earphone is the sound clarity, and boat surely doesn't disappoint here as well. a bit base heavy but the sound is clear, crisp and loud. good noise cancellation also helps to isolate the music playback. although, judging from a pure audiophile's point of view, the mi bluetooth earphones might have a more balanced sound signature, but boat, being a bit base heavy, is just awesome for hip-hops or bollywood genres. a music player with a good equalizer (preferably poweramp for android) is going to elevate the listening experience even more.battery: a single charge gives about 6-7 hours of music playback, which is decent enough, and full charge takes roughly about 1-1.5 hours.verdict: in a nutshell, boat rockerz 255 is worth the price tag and then some. with it's better build quality, comfort, bluetooth range, it packs more punch than it's competition. for the extreme purists, the sound signature might be a bit turn off, but for most people, even for people with good ears, this is going be a great experience.

( for switch on, switch off & connectivity)there is a small light indicator on the earphone that works fine.we can charge the earphone through adaptor or usb.consas it is a bluetooth earphone, therefore, it works great within a certain range. try not to go too far from your device(mobile or pc )while commuting if the volume is too high, the earphone cancels all the noise around us. this can be dangerous.overall this product is great . whether you are using it for voice or video calls or listening to music (soft or high bass) or listening to any video lecture.

"to those who doesn't get to know the realistic review about this product.i've been using it for 2 days and understood the sound quality. and i f-u-kin love these earphones.noise cancellation is very good. you can't hear noises until you try to hear them.comfortability. you can't listen for a longer period of time. it will start paining after 20 mins. these were not comfortable until i removed the wings. and i had some old eartips which i am using right now. these are more comfortable to me. and now i can listen to 4 hours straight without paining.battery life is excellent. used for 2 days and battery percentage dropped from 100 to 40%.now the sound quality.mids are average. won't miss any sound.highs (treble or vocals) is not up to the mark. but, if you adjust the equaliser settings then you can make it sounds so amazing.lows (bass) is so powerful. rockerz 255 was only made for the bass lovers i guess. their only focus was on the bass. these earphones have extra bass.(i am saying this so many times because it literally has so much bass)the people who are saying that it would have been better if it had more bass are stupid as fun.i have used some high and mid end earphones like sony mdr xb55 with extra bass, jbl t110 and oneplus bullets.at first when i heard, i thought i made a mistake by purchasing these earphones but when i equalised it. i made it sounds like some high end earphones. and i am very happy with the purchase now.you will only like this if you didn't have an high end earphones. but if you have never heard an high end earphones and wants some eargasm then i must say that you should go with the product. you'll be happy with the purchase and dont forget to equalise.

"i have been using this product since early feb and it still works like a peach. the sound quality is brilliant. never experienced a break in the bluetooth sync. no sound delay while watching videos and the battery life is excellent too.. i just have one complaint, well actually its faced by the people who i talk to over the phone. whenever i use this product to talk over the phone, they always complain about too much background disturbance. it does not cancel out the background sound of others talking around you. rather their voices gets amplified and i have to immediately stop using it. i validated this by being on the receiving end and the complains definitely is genuine. i think this is the only issue which restricts it from being the ultimate product.

"pros: 1.light weight, 2.fast pairing for bt, 3.comfortable fit,4.thundering bass!! good for bass lovers.5.google assistant works perfectly.cons: 1.no vibration for call alert,hence can miss a call if phone is away.2. due to extreme bass, sometimes vocals and fine instrument sounds get masked.3. at full volumes, bass is very loud which if listened for long time can cause ear and headache.but there is a solution to the problem, you can install '' black player'', which has tones of equaliser settings.so recommend people to use it and obviously go for boat rockerz 255, as it is value for money product!!! ??

"i have both boat wired headsets and sound magic. both of them have rich bass. i love them totally & am using from past few years.this wireless in-ear headsets doesn't have the richness in bass. may be the quality is compromised somewhere between the wired & wireless.except for this one drawback, this product is bang for the bucks you pay. it's lightweight, comfortable, long playtime and the offer price of 999 is excellent.if you're okay with decent bass, this is for you.apparao retail seller is doing a great job regarding offers & return requests.

"it is an awesome, i really like it cause the sound quality. and the most important thing is that it won't trouble your ears if you wear it for a long as i tried most of the headphones, wireless bluetooths most of them troubles me a lot if i put them into or on my ears for a long like 1 to 2 hrs. but this one is really awesome, the bass is superb, it won't fall down from your ears while running... amazing product. boat rocker 255 is really rocking as the name..... if i want to rate it so definitely it will be 5/5

"the product is amazing when it comes to sound quality and the material used in the making.it works decently at it's low pricing but the pannel of buttons on the headphones have stopped responding which as caused the mic to not work as well.but still the songs play well with any issues.....

"*writing the review after 1 week of use.product is good, the brand #boat you can trust it. sound is amazing and #bass for which i was excited is good enough. may be for some of you bass can be a problem but guys for a price of this plus wireless you can't expect more. also this product is long lasting. things i liked about this-1. design2. bass3. magnet4. it's durability

"the battery lasts approximately 4 hours continuously if it is connected all the time. the sound quality is good. noise cancellation is good. the neck band is flexible which is exactly what i wanted. i roll the headphones easily to put them in a case. the wire is very flexible and good quality.overall a good product.

"comfortable fit n good sound. my device stopped charging abt 4 months after purchase. i followed the online instructions to repair / replace the item as it was under warranty. must say boat has a very impressive online system which is efficient n responsive. the service centre took some time but i have received my earphones back hence the 5 star rating. all electronic items can malfunction but its the after sales service that really determines the serious ones and from this it appears that boat are here for the long run. good sound, comfortable fit, great after sales what more could one ask for.

"i used it for the past 10 days.it is really good for watching movies and for phone calls. i love it for that.!it's really bad for music. not only this all other bluetooth earphones in this rangei tried leaf sport 2, leaf collar 2(sounds similar to this one).jbl 110bt (hate it can't tolerate its sound quality for 10 sec).now i am buying a wired for my music love and gaming lag in bt earphones.if movies and phone calls are ur priority go for it best in this range alternate would be leaf collar 2if music is ur love then try staying with wired ones though it seems old fashion.honestly guys even 500 rupees wired earphones are better then bt 2k headphones. even mi basic sounds better while listening music ??.

"let me tell you this, i've used bose, beats, sennheiser, audio technika, jbl, skullcandy, boats and many tens of top and mid level brands. but i'm a fan of boats for their price - satisfaction ratio and used many of their products and never was disappointed.bought these earphones, i liked the build as soon as i saw them, loved the thumping bass when i tested it with multiple songs, loved the audio clarity too.and then an amazing thing happened.i was wearing them and was riding my motorcycle a bit faster and they blew away. an suv drove over it. i thought i lost the earphones. but when i put the buds in my ear, songs were still playing as loud, as clear as ever.button areas were damaged so badly but still, working perfect. i did not find any problem till now. i'm loving it.perfect value of money.*i wish i could have a replacement*
";-;-;-;-
"it has been a month since i got these earphones and these are my first own bluetooth earphones. however, i have tried many other earphones and headphones from different brands from my friends like boat, samsung, sony, skullcandy, jaybird, house of marley. i finally settled for this one because it's giving more than it's worth when compared to others. these are cheap in cost and rich in sound. casual music listeners will enjoy this earphones thoroughly.i will list some pros and cons that a casual music lover looks for...pros :1)deep boosted bass and balanced music at higher volumes...worth for money2)good fit, light weight and flexible neck band with sweat and water resistant... perfect for workout3)around 6 hours of play time at 80% of full volume and around 1.5 hour for full charge4) multi function buttons and different bud sizescons....1) little noise at the beginning that fades out as soon as the music starts2) disconnection ( lag in music ) due to displacement of device for the first time only. it gets settled after the first time you move it and stays connected with out any further disruption.

"these are a decent pair of earphones at the given price. i have earlier used the skullcandy and the jbl earphones and compared them, this is not a disappointment at all.the sound quality, clarity and bass are quite good. the quality of voice, when using for phone calls, is pretty nice too.the battery lasts for little more than six hours on continuous use after a single charge.i would highly recommend these earphones.

"i am using it for quite a time now & i have to say it's the best one in this price segment. sound quality is outstanding with high bass, it doesn't get wet even when i sweat a lot by running while wearing it. the noise cancellation could have been a little bit better, when on call the other person keeps telling me that background noises keeps on coming. battery backup is awesome also, it remained on 100% even after playing videos & songs constantly for 3hrs. to sum it up, i have to say it is the best bluetooth headset under 1500. you should really go for it.

"best deal if you are getting it under 1500. they are easy to use and sound quality is exceptionally good, which is least expected at this price. the built is such that they don't easily fit in any carry case especially not in the one which is mentioned in bought together catagory. the battery time is great but the info regarding the percentage battery left can be deceptive as displayed. one moment it displayes 60 % and next moment it's exhausted. but the backup is great . can be listned for more than 4 hours when connected

"got it at 900/- at a sale and it's a bang for the price. the bluetooth connectivity is quite good and connects properly everytime. the range is around 10 metres and the sound distorts if you are in another room. the sound quality is okayish.. neither too loud, nor too low. the disappointment is that the bass is flat. don't know whether this defect is only on my device or for the entire range. battery backup is around 4-5 hours. but will drain your phone's battery really fast. it's a really good deal for the price, but it is not that great!hit like of this helped you.. happy buying! ??

"just unboxed the boat rockers 255i am in love with the audio output.. its simply amazingjust a bit sceptical about the genuinitynot sure if i have received a new unit .. the area where the wires connect to the earpiece seem like it was stuck for the 2nd time.please notice in the image how well the area where wire meets earpiece near the green arrow looks well but the one near orange arrow is not... there is a white ring around it.

"i have used it for 1 day and no complaints till now. build quality is good. very light weight. sound quality is good. it has super extra bass so those who don't like extra bass have to think on it before buying. battery life is also good 5hour 35 minutes. saw 2 movies in a day along with attending calls. charging time is approx 2 hours. one of the good features i like that when you connect to android phone it shows headphone's battery icon next to bluetooth icon. that battery icon show how much charge is left.

"the product is super but it is not robust. the earphones does not last long. i bought it on sep 2018 and replaced it since one earpiece was not working within 4 months of purchase. the customer support is excellent but it takes 20 days time for the overall process. again after 9 months of puchase, one piece is again not working. sound quality is awesome. one cons is there that while calling, the other person recieves the sound too loudly any it irritates the receiver.
";Positive;-;-;-
"it is one of the best bluetooth based wireless earphones currently available in the market. the battery backup usually lasts up to 8 hours of continuous music listening. since it is in-ear design, hence noise cancellation is good, however, it lacks active noise cancellation, which i am sure is not present in any product of a similar cost.overall, it is a must buy and good to have.

"i am totally satisfied with the sound quality, durability, noise cancellation mic and finally battery was awesome but as a bike rider i am not going to suggest this one as it doesn't fitting to our neck when we ride two wheeler.when we r driving the band behind the neck is going back for air which is totally uncomfortable for user and pilon on the bike.for my samsung galaxy max through this bluetooth headphones i can't use google assistant as i not supporting for my device, i am not sure this problem is for everyone or not

"merits:-1. been using it for last 2 weeks. the earphone's sound and the bass is mindblowing.2. once if u fix the earphone into the ear you can't hear anything from outside even without playing songs.3. about the charging, they have mentioned 6hrs standby but it will be upto 7 to 9 hrs also if you are using it continually.4. sweat proof is also awesome, very flexible, weightless. demerit:-1. ear buds are not perfectly fit but u can enjoy enjoy the music.

"the sound quality is fine, the bass is also okay. they are very light, so if you use them while running or working out you don't even feel them. the battery life is also good. most importantly if you work out or run then you don't have to constantly worry about the wire being pulled. so for ?999 these are a good catch.

"the best part about this headphone is its sound quality, immersive and deep, way better than some of the more famous brands in this price range.however, there are no other major features in the headphone, and it is a bit clunky (not user friendly) to use.but if you just want to pay for the sound quality and not the frills, then this is an exceptionally good headphone

"as i get these for jus rs. 999, the sound quality is great for me in this price range with wireless connectivity.it gives me more then 6 hours of battery backup on every full charge ( got discharged in between 6-7.5 hours depending on my usage).i m happy that i bought it. ??

"quality is very good in this price range. bass is superb. i mostly use it for workouts. it does the job well. i face problem about noise cancellation as the other person on phone always complaints about unnecessary sounds from the sorroundings when i take a call outdoor. service delivery from boat is amazing and satisfactory. they replaced my headphones after 3 months as one of the buds started sounding low.
";Positive;-;-;Positive
"sound is very good.....but i think their is a design issue which make it not fit in ear properly.... that's why one can't experience the bass properly if not tightly pushed in. battery life is suprb upto 6 hours and charging time 1.5 hrs. but due to metal finishing in winter it becomes very cold and hurts the ears. the summer u can think....its a nice purchase for listening music but some designing faults i can see that's it.

"i bought this in amazon sell with sbi card in 900 rs. first, the bass of sound is very good.noise cancellation is good. all other features like buildup quality, ear fitting, etc are above average. not bed but don't compare with costly one. finally one line- good one batter then all other brands up-to 2000-3000. value for money if you buy up-to 1000-1100.

"not great sound quality. the bass is over amplified. but its a comfy fit and does an excellent job in cancelling out external noise. some of the jbl headphones in the same range will provide you with better clarity of sound, wherein the mids are well highlighted along with the bass. but if you like fo listen to music with heavy bass, then these are definitely a better pick. boat makes quality products for the given price.
";Neutral;Neutral;-;-
"excellent headphone for calls and music. but if you are gamer, you will face issue of sound. as it is bluetooth device, you will get sound delay by .5 sec. like when i play pubg using this headphone, i get sound delay. so sometimes its difficult to spot any enemy in close range. no issue with headphone, it is because of bluetooth connectivity. and you gonna face this issue in every bluetooth headset. so go for wired if gaming your priority.
";Positive;-;-;-
"amazing bass at that price range. play with equalizer and you can milk the most out of this earphones. however, one small drawback with this earphones is that when the earbuds is inserted firmly, it tends to kind of air lock the ear which is necessary for noise cancellation but not so good for your ears.

"this product's sound quality is impressive. the tagline speaks for itself - immersive stereo sound is truly what one gets. it charges quickly, and lasts for a long time (5 - 6 hours of use). i also own an audio technica m50x, but now it rarely sees use due to these quite marvellous earphones. note that these headphones costed north of ?9,000, while these earphones were a fraction of that price. good job, boat.

"it's my first day of use and the product is overall good as expected but just one dissapointing thing is the bluetooth connectivity it cuts off in between which is not pleasing when your listening to songs otherwise the sound clarity and bass is no doubt quality and up to the mark just the connectivity factor is something which bothers me let's hope it gets better in days...

"sound is good, noise cancellation is good, some very rare time the other side of person is unable to hear my voice which may b due to my mobile network not sure. one thing designwise i wanna mention here which i little feel uncomfortable is the size of the earpiece which bulges out so much tat when wearing helmet it gves a lot of pressure inside the ears from the helmet and it becomes air tight ?? if boat can make it little sleak or small in size!!

"keeping the cost in mind and the amazon's tag as a promise i bought this product and uts been a week since now and here is my review about the product.the initial impressions of the product is good and the build quality feels solid.it packs all the usual stuff which includes ear tips and other things.the design of the product seems good with a nice fit which helps in doing some exercises while in use.water resistant and sweat resistance functionality adds to the usage of the product under various conditions.coming to the performance, it definitely does good with some decent bass and the clarty is good.coming to the cons i dont feel there are many but the bass might be an issue for some people who use too high bass but thankfully thats not an issue for me.overall a worthy product

"the earphones are of good quality, was looking for earphones in budget, have tried boult space but these are much better, the bass as per the name is perfect, the vocals are also clear and overall the sound is pretty good compared to 'boult space' in which you hear only bass and no vocals. the only thing which i didn't liked was the distortion at full volume but that much volume is not safe for human ear, for better experience keep the volume at 75%.the ratings are below :-bass - 4.5/5vocals - 4.5/5fit - 5/5bluetooth range - 4.5/5battery - 4/5

"most of the i use wired earphones , but given there are situations in which a wire does get in the way 'such as when working outside' and it results in me accidently ripping , them out of my ears.hence i decided i should try out these wireless and see what all the praise was about, so i did my research and decided on these, so here is a pro's and con's list for any shoppers considering this item:pro's:-it comes with plenty of extra ear pieces.-battery lasts a long time.-it includes good packaging too.-wire around back of neck prevents earbuds from falling to ground.-the magnet holds earbuds together when not in use.-sound quality is actually quite good.-the contols are good and the buttons feel tactile too.-useful buttons for performing certain tasks.-noise canceling.-sweat proof.-quite inexpensive.cons's:-you have to charge it ""this is obvious but it still a negative when compared to wired versions""after these i have tried many other wireless earphones and they have changed my mind on going wireless, very good product overall

"purchased these headphones from amazon and were timely delivered. i've been using these headphones for a week now, here's a review -pros :1. sound quality is crisp - high, mid and low (bass) notes are clear and headphones are loud enough. given these are not in-the-ear headphones, i still need to keep volume at around 50-75%. but i really think loudness could differ from one mobile phone to another.2. battery is ok i guess, these are my first bluetooth headphones so won't be able to compare. once fully charged i can use headphones for 3-4 hrs.cons:only the earbuds/tips need some improvement, they slip out easily. other than that can't think of other points.*regarding durability can't comment at this point of time.

";Positive;-;-;-
"the product is surprisingly good. i thought at this price the functioning will be basic. but they have included volume keys too. audio quality and noise cancellation is also satisfactory. but the battery backup is very low. i'm only getting around 2.5 hrs backup while using calls. also it starts saying ""low battery!! please charge!!"" once the charge is below 20% repeatedly making it literally unusable
";Positive;-;-;-
"these are excellent bluetooth earphones as expected! the sound is clear with music , videos and phone calls. the caller can be heard very clearly as well as the caller can hear me with no disturbances. also along with these ear - plugs are so that the chances of sliping reduces. it is best for travelling as it is bluetooth earphones. along with this you will be getting charging wire and main benefit is that you will be getting 1 year warranty with it??????

"i don't understand what there reviews r for either the song u all listen to are of bad bit rate or u just dunno what to expect. i'm coming from using bose jbl n all n trust me as far as bluetooth codec goes for non samsung phone it uses sbc which is still good u just won't get the extra teeny beeny stuff like dolby n all if u have in ur lappy or phone but for samsung phones u can enjoy their own codec which r good sbc people say its bad coz low cost devices use it but u can check the net n research urself its really capable codec just give it the hardware to run it and for other devices that that says they use aptx well they do but their speaker can't even deliver what's the point in having aptx . but still the sound quality is excellent nothing to complain for 3k the kids high n lows r all balanced n superb everything is clear for all who want bass like the sony xb series not for u these arnt made to enhance bass but its there definitely n plays only when it needs to n i like that not making every little thing bassy is not good for the song too. battery life is good too i use with high volume ( coz u like it loud) at 100 n boy i got 8 hrs out of it which is normal coz companies usually advertise at 70 % volume. the mic is good too the person on the other end literally though i'm still using my bose soundlink 2 mic. not sure what's with the other reviews but imma say just go for it it's worth every penny. noise cancellation is passive noise cancellation u get 3 different size ear tips use the correct size n passive noise cancellation should work
";Neutral;-;-;-
"ossam looks, sturdy design, light weight. not recommended for music lovers as sound is too metallic n poor bass (unless you forcefully push it in ur canal n align it at a certain angle which may b painful after prolonged use) but a must have for calling. connects 2 devices at a timehowever after a few weeks use, i found that battery indicator is total waste. it may show 100% once then suddenly drop yo 55% n then keep steady at 55% n suddenly 0. so that's one thing samsung can improve in nxt update

"i have purchased u flex from croma and purchased another from reliance digital showroom. whether it a a voice call or music, this is top rated bluetooth headphone. samsung branding and premium quality looks is an add on. it works best with s8 and note8 above models (dolby atmos) and it has a dedicated app for sound effects.the most important advice i would like to give u all is don't buy from amazon or any other online websites. croma / reliance digital / samsung showrooms are the only official sellers of this product.

"i have bought this earphone out in a store and have been using this since the last couple of weeks. this is one of the best purchase that i have ever done in the audio segment. it has a good bass and proper sound clarity for both the music and calls. it really serves the purpose and it also has a very good battery life that keeps the device consume less energy even if its connected round the clock. with the use of samsung level app, one can customize options like vibration, app alerts, call alerts, battery level, etc. if you are using samsung mobile which is higher than s7(unsure if it works for models prior to s7), it also has the additional functions to customize the equalizer level as well. in my opinion, this has been the bluetooth audio device type that i have been looking to buy and i am satisfied with all the functions & audio it offers. i would definitely recommend this for any music lovers.

"i was looking for a budget friendly wireless earphones similar to apple earpods as those ""in-ear"" types don't fit my ears properly.i then came across the jbl tune 205bt randomly and i did not find any reviews online.i took the plunge and bought it. below is my review after using it for a couple of days:**fit/ergonomicsi really love these earpods style earphones as these fit my ears perfectly.these are light weight and passed my running/jogging tests without any issues.since i got these i just wear them around my neck and use it a lot without hurting my ears.rating: 9/10**built qualitybeing a jbl product i had no doubts that the build quality would be top notch.the cables are solid but the buttons are a bit squishy. i personally prefer clicky tactile buttons.since these are not connected to anything physically there is no tension on the wires which are around your ears which i imagine would prolong the life of these earphones.please note that the center button is to turn off/on and put the earphones on pairing mode.the other two buttons are to adjust the volume and you have to hold it for a second or two to skip tracks.rating: 7/10**soundto explain this better i’ll compare this with my previous earphones - boat bassheads which is fairly common.now, the boat earphones are the ""in-ear"" type and these usually provide better bass since they have a better seal and tunnel the sound directly in your ear but when i used them the bass seemed to be seriously lacking.i had enabled my phone's equalizer and used other software mods (viper) to improve the sound but still the bass sounded ""hollow"" like a deep snare drum.the jbl tune 205bt is a thousand times better in the bass department as i found it to be really deep and it has that thump (because of the 12.5mm drivers).i'm really impressed that these earpods sound better than in-ear earphones and are better than apple’s earpods too. i also used previously a couple of philips’ earpods style earphones but they too had the hollow bass effect.i'm currently using the jbl tune 205bt earphones without any equalizer as i find it to be tuned perfectly out of box. i generally listen to hip-hop and these jbl earphones really do it justice especially the 808 kicks.i was a bit sceptic at first about the sound reading the reviews of the wired version of these earphones online but i guess the people who are complaining about the bass not being good are really conditioned to crank up the bass to the maximum which then overpowers the overall sound spectrum.rating: 9/10**volume & noise cancellationsince these are bluetooth earphones the overall volume will be less than the wired ones.that being said, i found the volume to be enough and then some more.don't expect noise cancellation on these because of the earpods style tips but that's great for people who jog/run as you have to pay attention to cars, people shouting etc. but turning up the volume you generally don't hear outside sounds. i tend to keep mine around 70-75% volume.the sound doesn't distort at maximum volume.rating: 7/10**connectivity, range & callsthe jbl tune 205bt earphones support bluetooth 4.0 meaning no aptx or aptxhd codec support but that's okay because the improvements are only apparent when listening to high bitrate music (flac).(i have subscription to google play music which plays music in 256kbps and i have no issues with the quality).once these earphones have been paired to your phone, the next time you turn it on it connects in 1-2 seconds.i did not experience any disconnects or any lags. the range was pretty good, i leave the phone on the charger and move around the house without any interruptions.when we talk about calls, i didn't find these earphones that good because the microphone rests on your shoulder and i'm not one of those who shouts when talking on the phone but if you have a loud voice then this might work for you.rating: 8/10**battery life & charging timethe charging takes around 1 to 1.5 hours to charge from 0% all the way till 100% and based on my usage (which is a lot) these earphones easily last me a day.your mileage might vary.added bonus: you get the battery info on the status bar. i'm using op3t on oreo.rating: 8/10**pricei thought thousands of times before buying these as i never spent so much for earphones before.but in retrospect i'm glad i did buy these especially considering what you're getting in return.rating: 10/10***conclusionif you're on a budget and want earpods style bluetooth earphones then please buy this.you won't find anything similar or even close to the sound that you’re getting. i have many jbl products (2 bluetooth speakers, 1 home theatre system) so i can vouch for the sound.if you're a hip-hop or an edm head then you can buy this too as these have big drivers which won’t disappoint you if you crank up the bass using software equalizers.if this is your first pair of bluetooth earphones then be ready to be pleasantly surprised as these make your lives so much easier and i cannot imagine going back to wired earphones.

"my first jbl earbud. straight to point :1 sound quality - it's pretty good, clarity and tones. no thumping bass, but you should consider that these are not high end headphones but earphones. but you will get good bass, notes are clear. i had used apple earphones before and i consider them the best in earphone category and jbl is in par with it. and here it is wireless.2. battery life - is good and holding 5 hrs3. connectivity - very smooth and no hiccups of any sort. i am using it with iphone. p.s - near iphone battery life, it shows earphone battery life as well. i like it !!!4. noise cancellation - i don't know why people are rating noise cancellation for these earphones. it doesn't apply here. if you want noise cancellation earphones/headphones then you have to pay much extra bucks and buy which specifically mentions 'noise cancellation headphones'that's it.

"i would have given 5 stars however, please find below my reviews.at first i was very skeptical to buy this earphone after reading mixed reviews. since i needed a budget earphone i went and booked this. my first impression in regular usage was awesome. sound quality and bass impressed me a lot. definitely for regular music lovers this is the best buy and more than worth the money. i am taking away 1 star because i do lot of cardio (running) and because of music control the earphone tries to get pulled because of the weight and its really annoying. music control is definitely big and heavy. i have tried cardio on threadmill and never tried on road. as of now batter backup is good. i will revisit this review after couple of days usage.

"tired of reading? watch full indepth review videoand please please subscribe my channel on youtubejust search for 'jbl 205bt bluetooth earphone review ajit suryawanshi'so lets start review.....used the product for 1 month and then writing the review1. whats in the box? - in box you get micro usb to usb cable used for charging, product itself, and manuals2. build quality:- the build quality of earphone is really good. the cable is not braided but actually made up of high quality rubber. product feels sturdy and premium. hence in terms of build quality the product gets full marks.3. comfort:- talking about the comfort it's personal choice for me comfort is really good but some people found to be uncomfortable and doesn't fit well so i would suggest use apple earpods as a test. earphone doesn't fell off while running or driving. one side of earphone has soft rubber hence grip in ear is good. hence in terms of comfort i would give full marks4. features and functionalities:- in this area the earphone lets you down. the earphone doesn't support google assistant or siri. the earphone has three buttons. long press middle button will turn on/off the earphones, while single press is used to play/pause music or take/end calls. remaining two buttons are used to change volume and music track. single press will change volume and long press will change track. the volume buttons are hard to press initially but gets soft over a time. earphone has led indicator indicating on/off (white) connectivity (blue). it is blinking in pairing mode and stays still when connection is established. earphone uses bluetooth v4.0 hence in terms of range it won't be an issue. you can easliy travel from one to another room.microphone quality:- its good and gets job done.calling with these earphone will have no issues herebattery life:- the battery life of these earphone is average i would say. it would get around 4 to 5 hours of battery life which is average in my opinion. it will suffice for 1 working day with medium usage. but on heavy usage you have to top it up. watching videos or movies will drain battery faster.charging time hovers around 1:30 hours to 2 hours from 0 to 100%. earphone doesn't have any fast charging technology.sound quality:- here i would say its a bomb. it's surprisingly really really good. high are very clear mids are very well defined and base is also really good. you will love to hear all types of music. instruments and vocals are also very clear and well defined. but yes its not for basshead as earphone are not very bassey. base is very well balanced and doesn't affect mid and high tone. hence in terms of sound it will surely put smile on your face.pros:-1. good build quality and great design2. comfort is subjective but it's good3. sound signature is phenomenal4. good bluetooth rangecon's :-1. doesn't support google assistant or siri2. battery life is averageso lastly do i recommend to purchase these earphones? well definitely yes, an earphone is know for sound and in this it shines.so overall i would give 4/5 stars as it sounds really goodsupport by pressing help button if like the reviewand please subscribe to my youtube channel and please provide valuable feed in comment section. any questions ask in comment section of youtube will be happy to answer in only minutes.

"ordered these because of the apple earpod like eartips, which i prefer to the normal in-ear earphones with rubber tips. they fit really well in my ears. very comfortable to carry them around the neck. sound quality is very good...not too high bass, but not too low as well. they are very soothing to the ears. noise cancellation is not that good...but i'm not that bothered about that.

"a great product from jbl, as a bluetooth earphone it's really good, no connection issue, good noise cancellation, good bass and vocals. it's light weight, will not fill any weight in the ear, good connection range. support both android, ios in terms of control (buttons). connect well with laptop but sometimes it's gives fraction of second beep sound but no issues with mobile devices.

"one of those good bluetooth earphones in the market. bluetooth connectivity is very good and the sound output is excellent.perfect bass, no noise while listening to music with high volume. no sound distortion and mic is decent. but sometimes the mic is being hidden behind the collar of your shirt, so be careful. the battery backup is also good. you can feel the thumping bass when required and might be the sound output is awesome due to its 12.5 mm driver size. i used jbl t210, but this provides better sound.till now i didn't find any flaws in this earphone. i can say one thing - value for money, you wont regret buying this.

"this a genuine buyer verified review. jbl ain’t paid me anything to write this guys trust meso about the review will tel u sweet and simple.rating from 51) sound quality: 4.5 excellent sound as pure jbl signature and bass is good considering not a “in-ear” type setup. if u want good sound with bass and not a in ear type go for this it wnt disappoint you.2) useability: 5 out of 5 i bought it because in-ear was causing pain while wearing helmet but these are like apple earphone finish hence very easy to wear on helmet also.3) controls: 3 out of five as track forward and backward are missing4) battery’s life: 3 out of 5. dnt go with 6 hours gimmick it will last max 5hours mine gives average 4.5 hours in single charge.5) looks: 4 out of 5 looks great while wearing the only issue is the blue pairing light is always on which may annoy some people. but i think it looks cool. specially on the white colour one.6) noise isolation: 2 out of 5 as these are apple like shape u can’t expect noise isolation it’s good when u are listing alone but in high public and while driving bike surely u will have to put volume to max to isolate noise around u.overall happy with the product in this price range if u are looking for earphones without in-ear design and comfort as well good bass and build quality then u should must go for these without any doubt.
";Positive;-;-;-
"build quality is not satisfactory would've been better, battery is good enough though the sound quality is good need some improvements, for song changing you need deep press +/- button for at least 2-3secs, the worst thing is the mic though you adjust the position of it for several times whether your sitting, standing, walking, traveling and especially driving it is just shit, while your in a call it'll capture all the nonsense from the background clearly rather than your voice which is coming from just 1cm away. i think it has noise installation not cancellation. overall it is ok, except the mic and noise cancellation.noise installation: 5 ??noise cancellation: -5 ??mic : -1 ??sound : 4 ??bass: 4 ??battery??: 4??build quality: 2.5??charge time: 4 ??

"jbl has launched an affordable bluetooth headset without compromising on the sound quality... though a few days later, the richness of the audio has dropped and the rubber pads in the earpieces has come off... bottomline... sound quality is above average but build quality is bit on the fragile side.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"sound quality is excellent, along with the noise cancellation, battery haven't drained since the time i've bought it (i'm not a regular user) but still it's great. looks good, only problem i faced was fitting it into my ears as the ear piece is too wide (this is the problem i faced with almost all earphones). but the sound quality overcomes and makes your forget about it. i would definitely recommend it.
";Positive;-;-;-
"overall a good product but the only problem is the mic doesnt pic up the voice really well, either when putting it around ur neck u have to talk on high pitch or u have to keep the mic near to ur mouth so that the voice is clear & crisp to the other person on the line.

"i have been using apple airpods for 3 years now but after replacing multiple airpods due to it get broke after using while. i am a big fan of the sound quality offered by apple it was very difficult to find a good alternative due to which i replaced over 10 headphones by big brand names. i must admit that jbl tried best to make it perfect choice apple fans however the sound quality is not that great as my previous headset by apple
";Negative;-;-;-
"the product is very good for listening long hours of playback, you won't even feel that you got your earphones. the sound is good too. the fit is excellent as it has earpods fits. the only major issue is that it's not for call(even the feature is there but the quality is bad) the earphone get disconnect automatically sometimes from bluetooth and the left earpiece stopped working after 2 months usage(i got it replaced, which btw took 25days). see i myself is a that kind of person who doesn't forget it's earphone at home bcoz i can't survive the same city without it. i keep on listening to music for hours and hours. so if you are like me better raise your budget and buy bullet wireless.

"i'm personally not a fan of the ear-plug type earbuds so i went for this. initially, i was skeptical of the audio quality because these won't be able to seal into the ears as good as the plugs. however, to my surprise, their bass is comparable to some good quality in ears from the likes of mi & altec lansing.overall, i don't regret my purchase, got these delivered next morning with amazon prime.talking about the sound quality, sound is slightly bass heavy and suits my taste. the sound stage is colored and the highs are sometimes faded to compensate for the lows but it doesn't mean that they don't sound good. these sound fantastic!anyone who wants to listen to edm or bollywood go for these. good product from jbl.

"the worth the purchase. still the battery backup never seemed 6 hours per 2 hour of charging. the sound quality is good. very conformable to wear compared to other in-ear models. connectivity is on the spot too. the wires feel confident against breakin or snapping. i like it. but the soft rubber coating on the left ear came off in month. rough usage ??
";Positive;-;-;-
"pros:- like me, if you are a sucker for this in-ear design then you don't have many wireless options (and airpods are $$$). it isn't painful and they don't fall off, best is the use while laying sideways.- ~6 hrs on time: almost your days music- 1-1.5 hrs charge- excellent sound, excellent volume- yeah nice touch of basecons:- the rubber linings do come off due to poor glue which becomes ineffective in heat. just fevikwik it!- some bluetooth bugs

"one of the best headphone in my budget.
";Positive;-;-;-
"i usually don't write reviews, but i've bought two of these and haven't been disappointed.the sound quality is good, but for me, the best feature no one seems to talk about is the mic. i take a lot of calls, and though this doesn't have noise cancellation, it works very well for making calls in noisy environments. i rarely get complaints that others are not able to hear me or of traffic noise disrupting calls (a perennial problem in india). i'm able to take conference calls when travelling, which is a huge plus. the build quality is good. there is a problem that the wire connecting the audio input is weak and tends to break if not stored carefully. i've had that problem once, but sennheiser replaced this without question. i've started storing the pair in the pouch they supply and have not had issues later.the pouch really keeps things secure. a couple of days ago, i forgot to take it out of my shirt before putting it into the washing machine. i later realized this and picked it from the shirt pocket after the washing cycle, dried the pair and found that it worked as usual - a huge relief.i'm not a huge audiophile and don't wax eloquent on basss/treble reproduction and the like, but for me, this is a great pair for my use cases - good music playback, great service and ability to make calls on the street. i find very few reviews focussing on these, so wanted to highlight these for prospective buyers.

"i have used wide ranges of earphones over years, some brands being skullcandy (smokin buds 2), jbl (t 210), sennheiser (hd 180, hd 210, cx 271, cx400 ii precision, cx 185 street ii, and now cx 275 s) fiio (f1), koss (porta pro) audio technica (athcor150rd),first off there is a large difference between cx 185 street ii and cx 275 s don't even compare, cx 185 has too much of treble with very low bass, cx 275 s is very well balanced, cx 275 s reminds me of my cx 271 which i used for 7 years, its wire was of great quality and tangle free, i would have easily paid an extra 1k for that kind of cable,to anyone looking to buy earphones, go for audio technica>jbl if your budget is below 1k and sennheiser cx 275 s if you just need the best audio output, and regarding other earphones i've used jbl has decent output, and regarding fiio f1 it is just a piece of crap, it was an impulsive decision i made based just on the brand without any research, don't throw your money in garbage buying it, finally make sure you buy it from a well rated seller.

"firstly i would like to appreciate amazon.in for its amazingly fast delivery. the product reached in less than 24hrs and i opted for regular delivery.now about the product.i have used or still use products like audio technica ath-m50x , beats studio, powerbeats 2 , jaybird x2 , panasonic extra bass , bose soundtrue, mi piston3, etc .these sennheiser earphones are firstly extremely comfortable and lightweight. they have a very loud sound output. the bass is 4/5, treble is 4/5. the sound quality is rich and it doesn't feels like a sub 2k earphone. the earbuds are small and therefore allow a comfort fit while listening lying down or sleeping and they do not poke or irritate while listening for long hours.i purchased it for rs 1600/- , it comes with a leather case and a l - shaped converter which is very thoughtful .overall i would highly recommend.

"i don't know why this earphone is getting a lot of hate from a lot of people. quite frankly i've tried tons of earphones at this price point and personally the right amount of bass and excellent lows and mids would describe this earphone. if you want xtreme bass then i would suggest you to go for sony or jbl earphones. but this is a balanced earphone with the right amount of bass and good clarity.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"1st.. i will not say the buit quality is the best but it's good, you have to handle with care. nd the good point is,there is a pouch with nice quality & looks.2.. main thing i love the most in sennheiser is its sound quality. the sound is crystal clear. you won't miss a single component of music. the bass vocal treble are balanced. just catch it if you are a music lover.

"have been using it for over 10 days now and have been testing these beauties under extreme conditions and therefore thought of sharing my experience with this product. i will try to keep it short and to the point.note : you get 2 years domestic warranty with the product and to check the authenticity of the product, do scan the qr code given on the box.so here we go :??look and feelpremium- thats what you will feel when you hold in your hand for the first time. the material is of excellent quality and offers great durability. the earphones are slightly curved which fits in your ears very comfortably. the three button remote is of high grade rubber and feels smooth while touching.??connectivitythe cx6 from sanheiser comes with bluetooth 4.2 and connecting your phone is a butter smooth operation. i have tested it with a distance of about 15 meters and never faced any issue.??battery and chargethe product claimed of a 6 hours long battery backup but you will get around 5 to 5 and a half hours. but the best part is it supports quick charge and even a 5 minutes of charge can give you over 1 hour of support.??sound outputthis is where the real test starts when we talk about a headphone and specially when it is at this cost. i have used bt headphones of other companies and can assure you that at this price point, its not the beat sound output but there are no competitors too. the sound is crisp and clear. the treble is just awesome, you can hear every lows and highs of it but the bass is not the best. the bass should have been a little more because thats what i like but again thats depends on person to person. but i can assure you that you will be pleased to hear the music in this headphone and even for long continuous hours.for those giving negative reviews, its adviced that you download the song at the best bitrate and then try this headphone.??call qualityhave been using it since 10 days now and during all these days, i have tried to use it as rough as i could in all kind of noisy and louder situations but the product has never disappointed me. the sound cancellation works simply superb and the other party could hear me clearly even when i was in the noisiest condition. never faced any issue over call quality till date. but many months to go and hoping that the brand will keep its good name as it usually does. kudos????verdictsanheiser has been understanding music and sound since 70 years and one thing can be assured that you wont be disappointed with their product. if you are a sanheiser user, there is nothing to be said about the quality but about this product, you can definitely give it a try and you wont be disappointed and for those who are planning to buy sanheiser for the first time, reading reviews wont help you, you need to make a buy and experience it yourself. since i have been using this product, i can assure you that using bt headphones for longer hours will not be a pain for your ears anymore. i hope that this review has made you make an informed purchase decision because overall you would be spending your hard earned money. thanks for reading and happy shopping !!

"let me get this straight, the sound from these is amazing. the highs and mids are clear and the low bass end is great. recommended for bass heads. fit is comfortable and they don't fall off from the ears.now the shortcoming, these earphones are not durable. the wire is very thin as compared to other earphones. in the unit i received, sound from the right ear piece had reduced to half after only 3 months of use. but as sennheiser gives 2 years of warranty, they replaced the earphones without asking any questions. right now using the replacement ones and they've been working great.

"sennheiser are known for their great studio grade sound quality with a flat eq, and this pair is no different. i really love the sound quality of these headphones, it is full with equal emphasis on the lows, mids and highs without any artificial bass boosting. you get a flat sound which makes this pair really versatile. it is great for movie watching and voice calls. the mic is great. everyone i called using this pair said i sounded clear with no distortions. also these come with 2 years warranty which is very nice to have.now let's get to the cons, and as usual its the built quality. the wires are thin and made up of flimsy looking rubber. i have seen braided cables in headphones much cheaper than this. i would have loved sennheiser to at least give some quality materials, because you have to really take care or else i feel the wires will break. also the mic button feels cheap.overall, this is a great pair of headphones for anyone looking for rich and clear sound. if you like bass, something from sony would be better for you.
";Positive;-;-;-
"starting with the package, the box the earphone comes in is very beautiful.now coming to the earphone itself.sound quality:bass is good and of high quality, highs and lows good and overall listening quality is enjoyable.mic:crystal clear mic, works well, very less noise while calling.comfort:very comfortable. the earhooks on the back of the ear doesn't seem to hurt in longer usages. the overall weight of the earphones is less and hence is very comfortable
";Positive;-;-;-
"sennheiser cx275s is a superb in the ear headset. sound quality is awesome with clear reach bass. carry with a synthetic pouch & a 3.5mm connector. packaging also great. only cons was wire too thin. before i used cx180. after 10months used cx180 one-sided earphone was showing defects. i login a complain. i would send that product to sennheiser headquarters. then they should send a new product to me between 10days. i want say to sennheiser you are no1 brand in the world, so concentrate on wire quality. then no any other brand can reach you
";Positive;-;-;-
"the build quality of the headphones are pretty nice. the wires look very thin and fragile though. three types of earbuds were provided. the pouch given with the headphones are very useful for carrying the headphones around. value for money.the jack could have been angled instead of being straight to avoid getting frayed. it hasn't frayed till now though. very few headphones come with 2 years warranty in this range so that's a plus point.the listening experience is pretty decent. the bass is well balanced. mic and mic button function very well. the mic works well when its held close to the mouth.
";Positive;-;-;-
"this is one of the best product at this price point. the sound quality is just amazing. loved it. treble is on point. bass is powerful. mids are balanced. overall a joy to hear music in these earphones.build quality is also very good. using for around 6 months. no problem whatsoever.i would strongly recommend senheiser over other manufacturers.
";Positive;-;-;-
"i have been using these headphones for over a year now and there is zero complain on it. the bass of the sound is perfect even the 4d sounds are really cool you can hear them really well. the product comes with three ear buds in different sizes so you can select the one which fits your ear properly. the noise cancellation it is awesome once plugged into your ears it cancels out the sound from out completely and it detangles easily, have a long wire, the microphones are good to communicate hence one could not ask better from earphones.
";-;-;-;-
"less bass with more clarity. idle for long listeners and not recommended for bass lovers. you won't stress out even after listening for hours. am using this from past 4 years and i don't see any wear n tare on it and also because i handled it carefully
";-;-;-;-
"i don’t think there is any match for these sennheiser earphones !!! absolutely amazing !!!i had an earlier version of these from last 5 years and just because they worn out i had to keep them aside.. i’ve had iphone’s earpads, audio technica, sony, phillips, mi n few others, nothing satisfies as these do. the moment you have them in your ears, it reduces 40% of external noise(remember these are wired earphones).the sound(music, voice, movie) it just heard in your head. not the ears..,!!
";Neutral;-;-;-
"the battery life is a little low for my taste. apart from that, cx 6.00bt are a solid pair of earphones with well built structure and housing for the drivers; they have a wide frequency spectrum with pretty flat sound signature with a little bit of coloring (boosted bass and treble frequencies). sennheiser’s engineering is yet again proven to be the best. cx 6.00bt may not be a cheap pair of wireless earbuds, but trust the sennheiser’s reputation and you’ll be surprised by buying these earphones how much well worth sennheiser’s products are. sennheiser is a german company, and germans are known for their engineering skills, even in audio.note: for people looking for bass heavy earphones, cx 6.00bt should not be one of your choices.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"used the earphones for over 7 hours today on a train journey, absolutely no fatigue or any kind of irritation on or in the ears, the large caps provide a snug fit and cancel out external noise to a great extent, the wires look deceptively thin, but can make out it is quality build, reason for 4* & not 5*is because the wires get tangled way too easily and frequently, which is very annoying, also not rating below 4*is purely coz of the worldwide warranty it's not going to wow at this price range is my personal opinion, definitely more than a good product without doubt, especially comfort level (4.5)update : after 6 months of use, it's sturdy as hell! definitely worth the money
";Positive;-;-;-
"pros:1. nice sound quality (4/5)2. earphone fits easily (3.5/5)3. call quality while receiving call is good (4/5)cons:1. build quality is not that great because of thin wire. either it will get cut off or tangled easily, you have to be bit careful(2.5/5) for build qualityoverall value for money. you will get best earphone in mid range earphone.
";Positive;-;-;-
"though on the expensive side of the earphone market,the cx-275s from sennheiser is one of the most loved and trusted headphones in the segment.plenty of reasons for this support namely the amazing sound quality from the earphones,the good looks of the headphone and german built.however,the wire is rubberised and may seem fragile to many while the 3.5mm jack connector shouldn't be handled roughly as chances are that the wire may get loose and you may get distorted sound.overall,a good product with some great audio quality to make you enjoy your moments even more.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"sennheiser cx225s has been on my list of earphones to try because of its earpiece design. i love that it's in-ear model and comes with a total of 3 earpieces; small medium and large. i use the small ones. they're very extremely weight and don't seem to weigh the earphones down while they're in use.the mic is pretty much what made me buy this. quality of sound on call is very good and i majorly only use them for attending calls and watching videos on youtube, netflix and amazon prime. they work pretty well for the purpose.cons:i use a nokia 8 and these headphones give a constant buzzing noise in calls while the other person on call talks. the little connecter is even worse. mutes my voice completely on the other side. consider this if you use a nokia phone.
";Positive;-;-;-
"thump is here....what can i say just buy it and feel the thump sennheiser is like bose substitute...u won't feel to keep it back just always like to put on and have fun....writting it after 2 years of use and not a single defect wires look sleek but are damn high durable as it used to get entabgled to my bikes handle and boss it still rules over every other earphone in this price range like a thallaiva....german engeering at its best is what sennheisseer resembles.
";-;-;-;-
"so i have been using the current pair of cx 275s for more than 6 months now. i use them regularly on my daily commute (of an hour) to work on my bike as well as in the office for skype calls (which usually means nearly 4-4.5 hours out of the 9 hours at work)the sound quality is good. however, if you are looking for extra bass then perhaps these may not be where you should be looking at.they are quite comfortable for regular use and the noise-cancellation is quite good at this price point. the 2 year warranty that is provided, makes these the most bang for buck earphones. if ever, you face issues with the earphones as long as they are within the warranty period, replacement is quite hassle free. (applies to the cx180 as well which i owned earlier as well)to sum it all up, if you are looking for a good pair of multi-purpose earphones for regular use you cannot go wrong with these.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"cons:i was a bit skeptical of buying the sennheiser cx 275 due to the reactions on it's durability. i was correct on that part, the wires are too thin making the device vulnerable to wear and tear (and we are considering to buy a wire protector).pros:apart from that we have been blown away with the comfort while listening to media, it does not stress out your ears. noise cancellation features are true to what they have claimed and the music streaming is the best( true to their reputation)all in all, i am satisfied with the purchase just that need to be a but careful with the product ( cannot be handled as how we really do with our usual earphones)
";Positive;-;-;-
"important: this earphone is a quality product. anywhere below ?1400 it is a great buy. the value does drop below ?1400 on sale and special occasions.description:included with the earphone is a beautiful leather pouch and differently sized earbuds.the bass is good and the audio clear.you may think it is fragile but it will surprise you.the wire is mostly tangle free.noise cancellation is good too.
";Neutral;Positive;-;-
"it is for clarity of sound. keeping price in mind - it could be one of the best options. excellent for calls. good for music. it is quite balanced. this is not for bass lovers at all - about right on all bands. loudness is perfect. you will probably not need to play it full volume ever.cable is not sturdy or strong - be careful not for rough use.apart from that it comes with required stuff - like variable size tips - choose carefully to get noise cancellation.very light and comfortable - you will not feel it.it has everything that is a sign of great design - l - shape connector, leather bag.given the on-the-go use case that this product is primarily for - a good sturdy cable is the only thing that i marked it 4 start for - otherwise - it is highly recommended.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"don't think these are suitable to working out but are pretty good for general lifestyle usage. the wire is long but is meant to only stretch upto an extent, do not test its durability. sound and mic quality is pretty good, i've been using it for 2 years almost and quality is still brilliant.the silicon ending of the earphone might break but it's not noticeable, the important problem is that the earbuds fall off when you use it a lot as it becomes looser, you get a replacement back (although different sizes only) so that's good.i'd say if you're looking for cheap, good earphones with a mic, this is the one.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"have been using this earphone for the past 10 days. for me, this ticks all the boxes, perfect sound quality, light weight, good fit and in ear comfort. i would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily use earphone.only drawback is that no pouch came along this. last year i had purchases the previous version of the sennheiser earphone and it came with a good pouch, but this one even though double the cost, did not have a carry pouch.. otherwise the product is great.
";Positive;-;-;-
"if it falls in your budget, get it. that's all there is to it.i was restricting my budget to 900 because i have never felt the need for an expensive earphone despite my dialy use,so i kept pushing my purchase of the 275 for 3 years. finally i decided to get it and it's great. i loved the cx 180 and this is even better. very crisp,clear and decent noise masking. it's light,it's comfortable. it's got a mic that makes superb calls. i don't think you can beat this ,despite the premium over the jbl c100si

"this product is good but in this price range probably not so mucg value for money as you get disappointed because you are paying that much but u get an over average product .still it's sennheiser i say it is okay.here are my rating for better understanding :sound quality: 4/5bass:3.3/5build quality:5/5noise cancellation: 4.5/5battery life: 3.5/5value for.money:3.2/5pros:- have nice design n build-withstand rough use-sound quality is not top of world but good-fits comfortably n easily- can connect to 2 devices at same time-sound clarity n originality is maxcons:-battery life not much-sometimes our of sync with youtune video n audio but if u reset synced again-no travelling pouch is given as i guess for that price it should be given-not bluetooth 5-basss is not much: if y r heavy bass user then leave it

"sennheisers are meant for the production of perfect sound. these aren't for bass listeners. these are only for high fidelity sound listeners. i am using sennheiser since 5 years firstly cx 180, then cx 3.00, and now cx 2.00g. these have a perfect flat sound response. has high treble, balanced bass.the only issue is that they are very sensitive to humidity, sweat, and water. i had kept them in my front pocket in the humid climate in mumbai. the one side that encountered sweat, or humidity and sounded a little low. but got replaced in the service center. just be cautious while using it and prevent it from any type of water or sweat. their service centers are only big cities in india, and getting them replaced is a tedious task. sennheiser please note this issue that these earphones are very prone to water. i had used cx 3.00 and they did not have this problem (by the way i had put them in washing machine thrice) but the sound was not affected a bit and lasted more than 3 years (after which its wire got torn). so for the sound, these are perfect, but only if you prevent it from water.

"i was really confused before purchasing...as there are many reviews ..for cx275s...bt this one had better base and sound quality...also...there is volume ctrl remote...so i went for this one.and...now i feel...my gut feeling really paid well...this one is just absolutely fantastic. balanced sound...decent treble...and bass. base is on the heavier side. overall audio quality is just amazing.i purchased this 5 days after getting cx180...which i didnt like ..as the treble was too piercing. go for this one if you want some bass backed music...with balanced treble.

"well first things first .awesome product jst buy it ..but here are some pros and cons .pros:-1. good clear crips sounds.2. bass is adequate enough but i think it is lacking bass .( but enjoyable )3. design is good .4. noise cancellation is good.5. 2 warranty is great .cons:-1. the wire is so thin i'm having doubts about the durability of the product .. (since it's about 1700 the product should have be gud ( should have given a breaded cable))2.bass is not enough i think (considering the price).overall the best earphones u can but if u can look past the thin wire and not enough bass .
";Neutral;-;-;-
"i like the clarity of these headphones. noise cancellation works best if there is a good seal between your ear cavity and the head phones. however, this tends to prevent air circulation within the ear for me. i found this air tight feeling to be uncomfortable. hence, i usually wear these headphones with some clearance so that air can flow freely into the ear cavity. however, this results in reduced noise cancellation properties. overall, these are a good bunch of headphones!

"i bought it on 7th march 2015 and i am very much impress by the quality of sound and bass.after use of more than 3 year sound quality remained same as 1st day of use only thing observed that wire covering got few cracks bcz of wear and tear. (after rough use)thats y i was looking for new headset to buy, done some days in r & d about headset.but again found these headset are still the king of headset in this price range.....so bought them again now in 2018...hats off to sennheiser...??????if you have budget of 1.5k then go for these and if its under 1k then go for cx180(under 800 with same quality) without a doubt but u have to compromise with mic.dont thing just go for it...

"the overall sound experience is very gud. this is completely balanced for bass and terrible. you'll experience all the details. this is been six months i am using it. the best part is few days back it was having some issue so i went to sennheiser service center and they replaced it immediately. i am very happy for their service. i do recommend to all if anybody love music they can go ahead with product, may be you'll say the price of this product is a bit higher than other brands but i would say quality and service of this brand is best. a big thanks to sennheiser.

first of all, i love the design of the earbuds, very unique. i was using sennheiser cx180 before this and they worked perfectly for two years no issue at all. jst that they didnt have a mic so i got these. they are very comfortable and sound quality is great, balanced. only the cable is too thin, looks fragile it was like that on cx180 too and nothing happened to that so i dont think it will be a problem.i ordered one and after using for a day i realized the mic wasnt working properly and the button also didnt respond sometimes, but i got it replaced and now no issue with it. ;Neutral;-;-;-
"the sound is absolutely superb for this price. no complaints. also a superb faux leather pouch free with it!cons:the plug is a straight one, instead of a 90° bent one. so it'll definitely be kinked there and prone to break.the wires are very thin and round. feels very flimsy. i don't know how long it'll last. i'd recommend some wire protectors.the in ear plugs are just okay. not too happy about the shape and size of it.

"i'm writing this review after about 6 months of use.material quality:the build quality of this product isn't on par with with some other products at this price range as the wires are thin and unbraided which often causes them to get entangled pretty easily.durability:after 6 months there is normal wear and tear which also depends upon individual use but they are working just fine.sound quality:the most important one for most of us,so the sound quality is what made me fall in love with these earphones.they're just perfect for my taste as the bass isn't that intense and the mids and lows are just on spot.to sum up:it's a pretty decent pair of earphones for their price with great sound and average build quality.i say go for it.ps: if you are confused between jbl's earphones and this one,just go for these as they sound much better

"these are incredible headphones. i had bought a one three years back. there is hardly any damage to the headphones. i use them for taking calls, listening to music, working out, etc and they seem to hold ground everywhere.the buds fit snugly into the ear and the headphone doesn't slip even when working out.the music quality is excellent.the bass is punchy and not super thumping. the mids and highs are balanced. i used songs like jumbalika, thriller, etc to test them and you can feel the different instruments distinctly.recently i had wanted to buy new ones and found that these stand in comparison to 1more dual driver and boat nirvana tres headphones in most features.i'm quite satisfied with this buy.

"many audio enthusiasts have been scouting for good bt earphones, but jbl and sony have dissapointed at the lower end. most of the big names have been too busy amping up the battery or range. so i'll keep this about sound quality only, as the range and battery life is as good as the others. many reviews have been too critical about the ''lack of bass' but let me assure you that these beauties produce 90% of the sound signature of the sennheiser 275, which is a huge compliment for a bt earphone in this class. since the bass is not overpowering, the mids and highs are crisp and clear , resulting in true sound. yes, the drums and bass guitar is nowhere as booming as on sony xb55ap, but it is just good enough for knopfler or gilmour's guitar to sound true. while i love the bose truly wireless buds sound (sans the audio lag!), i found this close to bose soundsport bt performance at half the cost.bottomline: if you're a sennheiser loyalist, you won't be dissapointed at this price point. they are light, don't feel much, fit right and have awesome build quality. these are the best bt earphones i've heard under 10k.

"i received my earphones today and although this review might be a little preemptive, i felt it was necessary to put in a word to address some concerns that potential buyers might have. one of the first concerns i had was if the product was fake; because a few other reviewers pointed to the same. as soon as i received the package, i went to the sennheiser website to make sure that my product was genuine. it was, indeed. my primary concern allayed, i opened the package and i was very happy with everything. you get a 3.5mm adapter, extra ear buds, a pouch, and a manual. the earphones themselves are just fantastic, i tested them quite rigorously today and they held up very well. the bass is not extraordinary, but it's very good quite frankly speaking and unless you're an obsessive audiophile, you shouldn't be disappointed with the sound. the build quality is good, they don't feel cheap. i played a range of music, from your bollywood numbers to trance to hip-hop to death metal to djent even and found that the sound was quite good and enjoyable. at decent volumes, these earphones shut the world out and immerse you in the music completely. at the price, these earphones are a steal. i'll continue to use these and revise my review if they ever fall short of expectations.

"prior to this earphones i have used jblt150a, sony mdr-ex150ap, sennheiser cx 180 all of them were good products which lasted 2 years except jblt150 which i had to replace after 6 months. i tested sennheiser cx 275 when my friend bought it and i knew which earphone would be my next daily driver. its audio quality was great in all freq ranges whether its low, high or mid it was engineered perfectly. biggest con of the earphone is its build quality the wires are too thin and could be damaged easily for a rough user it will brake easily(for such user i would suggest to go for something with kevlar,flat or braided wires ) i consider myself a rough user i would fell asleep with my earphones on plugging it on either phone or my laptop. it finally took a tall on it. it started tearing of on joints and and other parts were it usually bend or gets tangled today its left driver stopped working due to damage on the wire. it worked perfectly fine for 2years which is great considering its thin wires.

"believe me guys, these are way better than skullcandy method earbuds. i bought these because my methods worn off. i was a little skeptical about these, but after listening to just one song, i could tell the difference between my skullcandy methods and these. the bass is good, treble is good, it just ticks all the boxes for me.just that i could be a little cheaper. 2345/- is a bit too much for this model (because it is not the latest one). overall, if you can buy these, surely go them.

"a review by a sound enthusiast.awesome sound quality of mids and treble, clear and pleasent treble , smooth and soft mids but one needs to equalize the freqencies a bit for that perfect balance of mids and trebl.andneodynamium magnet - so active bass outputbass is preset low by default on this but..this earphone has capability to produce bass more then your ears can handle but to produce that much of bass a custom audio driver is required.to play low and ""feel the pressure"" of this frequency one needs an audio driver which amplifies this frequency range.mobile phones doesn't have this amplification....and cannot be done much with an equalizer from playstore.so dont judge this on its default low bass setting.one con is wire is too thin.. and can easily break. other then that an awesome earphone in every aspect except thin wire.

"it's been just over 2 months since i purchased these headphones.. good balanced sounds, with good clarity.. even while on call. the overall pitch is higher than bose, but the sound quality is almost the same.. bass is not punchy, likeable. highs, mids and lows are very well balanced, you can hear every note and instrument in the background. can be a suitable alternative to bose in ear wired headphones. the only place where bose notches up is in the reproduction of overall sound, which gives a surround sound like feel.. and no doubt more clearer sounds. but this still is a good and cheaper alternative

"the model and the sound quality is is on par excellence. the moment i saw these headphones and plugged them in, there wasn’t any resistance in inserting them. the angled design gives a great comfort that my ears aren’t irritated anymore and i have spent hours and hours listening to songs before my ears start crying from pain caused by the structure of the buds. this for one has two variants and i wasn’t aware that one supports the android and the other ios.the reason behind cost difference between both of them is an unknown fact on my side and hence i chose the wrong os headset since i use apple. that may be the downside on my part and the length of the wire is an issue which in turn gets intertwined with each other and i seriously fear that because of this i might not utilise the product’s life.altogether put it’s a great product and if you’re looking for android cx2.00g is your model and cx2.00i is your ios variant. be cautious and order accordingly, unlike me.

"ordered product on early september 2018, delivery was timely as usual. after approximately 6 months of use, here's what i observed.pros1. sound quality is really good. covers frequency ranging from 10 hz. to 15,000 hz. means, excellent bass, and remarkable treble sounds.2. the mouthpiece, or the mic, is also really good. i have found that the clarity at the other end is pretty good even when i am riding a bike @60kmph, which brings me to another point3. i occasionally listen to songs on this earphone while riding bike, and i have to tell you, noise cancelation is phenomenal.4. another good thing i noted about this piece is that, while you are on a call and you speak on the mic, the earpiece gives you a feedback of your voice. in other words, you can hear yourself speak on the earpiece, which i found to be an interesting quirk. reason being, in most of the noise cancelation earphones, you can't hear your voice, except for a deep rumbling on your chest (try speaking with your fingers plugging your ears)cons1. well, the wire noise is a bit turn off. could have been better, but it is not too much to complain about anyway.2. now this one really gets me. the left and right earpieces are reverse! from a brand like sennheiser, this simply is negligence. now, this doesn't make much of difference to someone who does not really care about where the sound is coming from, but for music lover like myself, this is a bummer. your favorite song does not sound, well, like it should.but then, you can always switch your ears... put left on right and right on left. that fixes everything, and there is no discomfort in your ears if you do so.but still...anyway, a 4 star from my side. fix the left right issue, and its a 5 star product.

"writing this review after i used it for more than 3 years. so consider reading the complete review.first the cons:1. wire is a bit thin. but very smooth to handle.2. if not kept in a proper case, it'll take you few seconds to unwind.3. none other that i know of.pro:1. highly durable if you care enough for the things you use.2. the 2 years warranty is something. if you find the music is not as good as when it was new due to some issue in earbuds, return (courier or in person) it to the sennheiser guys. provided it is physically undamaged, they will hand you over a new one.3. noise cancellation is optimum. pedestrians must avoid using it if in heavy road traffic.4. awesome music quality. you can actually distinguish between different frequencies and different instruments that has be used. mid and high frequencies sounds crisp. bass could have been better. ofcourse you mustn't compare the quality with the ones you get with 3k-4k bucks.5. use it for long hours, i mean really long time, still you won't find anything uncomfortable with you ears. can be used comfortably while you're sleeping in you bed.6. though i don't have prior experience using any big company earphone products, i had bought it after researching all the products/reviews available online. believe me i'll again go for this if i had to buy a new one. the best in this price segment.

(i can give u a tip to check your audio listening devices. play ""bohemian rhapsody by queen. the song covers all most all freequency levels, with different vocals and instruments.) no sickening high bass. those who love thumping bass may opt for other ear phones.but....... this product is not worth what it costs. the same quality of sound can be obtained from a jbl c100si earphone as well (durabilty of the mentioned jbl product is below average. i couldnt even use it for one year) but it costs only half the price of this product. i cant say anything about durability at this moment, since i bought this just one day back only.hoping for the best...

"first of all, i love sennheiser. there's no one better in the game when it comes to audio equipments. earphones are very durable. these have been in washing machine like 5-6 times now (mistakenly). but i just take them out and leave them for drying for 1-2 days and they are back to normal. cord has been pulled numerous time. twice, i thought no way these could survive through this much pulling force. but, i underestimated it. i got these as an upgrade from cx 180 after using them for 3 years. i recommend these.

"keep in mind to turn the volume dial down....these thing is scary loudand more scary when you add a portable amplifier with it............and for the ones who need a flat tone... don't mind taking it.....just tweak the equaliser to vocal or more mids and high to nullify the bassy side of it. loved the scary volume

"a great product from sennheiser..review after usage of 1.5 year.pro: good sound quality. smooth base. good material for rough use.cons: mic quality is not that much on voice calling.but when using recoder it's good.small sound from call button.after 1.4 year use the left ear piece stopped working.i send the fault product to the sennheiser service center.they replace the fault product with brand new one.great service from sennheiser team..

"i could not find any headphones at this price range or below which provides awesome sound quality. but the wires are so delicate and if not handled carefully, there are greater chances of the wire being damaged. been using it the past 1 year and after 8 months, the left earpiece stopped working. but was able to claim warranty without any hassle. just make sure to buy it from reputated sellers to avoid getting non authentic one's.

"sennheiser cx 275 are the best wired headphones available. the concentration is more on the quality of midrange output rather than ear deafening bass. one can put on these and listen for hours without any fatigue. bass heavy headphones cause ear fatigue. the quality of sound gives you the opportunity to listen to those notes in your fav songs which you may have never been able to listen on a regular cheap bass heavy headphones.

"product related:pros:1) high quality sound (bass-trebal-mids are optimally set)2) intricate design with good packaging.3) microphone is highly receptive and sound quality is good.4) plays well with all types of music and adjusts to the variations very quickly.cons:1) very very delicate. try to mess with it will get damaged.2) extremely thin wires makes it tangle easily.3) cannot distinguish left and right (maybe anyone can be used i presume)4) cannot be used in extremes (running, gym-ing etc) - i fear of damaging it as it's so delicate.amazon service: one word for it - amazing!!!

"awesome earphones i have ever used. i am big fan of music and high quality sound fascinates me. for me, compromising sound quality is a big deal. but, this product lives upto my expectations and beyond that! after using this earphone, i don't feel like using any other products. it's my 4th year with this earphone (of course i lost my previous one and had to order the same product!) and it does not disappoint me any day. highly recommended for music lovers at this price which i think is quite affordable.

"sound quality is excellent for this price range.i have compared it with other similar range head phones. i can't say that built quality is that good.everything is from plastic,but it won't hinder the sound quality.the wire could have been of a bit more thick and tangle free material.overall the product met my expectations.

"when i first tried these ear buds, i did not have them far enough inside the ear and the sound was very tinty.this morning, i seemed to have placed the buds further into my ears and the quality of the sound improved 1,000 fold.the size of the rubber ear pieces is extremely important. the bass seems absent unless the buds are fully inside ear. the only downside i see is the lack of volume control and ability to switch tracks when listening to music. hope to have provided a helpful review.

"hey there, i am using this earphones with my iphone 6s plus and so far it’s been a good experience. the only problem with these earphones is that you can never hear it with volume full and they are very delicate. the problem with sound it that your ears will bleed, as it’s sound quality is not good at full but yes if you keep it with volume at 75% it will give you an awsome sound experience which you’ll love. at this price-range it’s a good deal. 4/5 rating for it’s sound quality at this price.

"i've been using soundmagic es18 for about past 6 months and i find it very good value for money headphones.the sennheiser cx275s is also a very good value for money headphones ,a little more stylish than the soundmagic es18 .sennheiser cx275s sounds really good, even though the bass is very power it is clear and not overpowering. you can hear sound of each and every instrument clearly.the quality of these headphones are very good and it supports mic also. when compared to the soundmagic es18 you can go on hearing bass overwhelmed songs for hours and it doesn't hurt your ears but soundmagic es18 starts hurting after sometime. these headphones also comes with a warranty of 2 years.finally these headphones are real value for money under rupees 1500.

"fulfilled by amazon, so packaging was good. it came in a compact packing. quality of the audio was good.. noise cancellation was decent, though i didn't test it much except for listening to music in front of the tv or somebody talking. you can take calls and end calls with the call button. it is the only single button present there. voice quality is average and it was snubbing the voice a bit. on the main screen if you press the button, it would open the default music player and starts playing a song. if you press again, it will pause it. it is capable of capturing fm radio signals. this is tested on samsung s3 as a headset. on apple ipad as a headphone. the volume up down buttons were not present. while some commented that it is thin (and it is compared to my stock samsung headphone), it is not fragile.

"sound quality is good. bass and treble balance is adequate. its priced slightly on the higher side may be because of its looks and brand name. i would suggest to them to cut about 200-300 bugs on it if they want to steal the costumers away from other brands. as such one cannot see the design once they are in your ears. built quality is good and they provide a small pouch with it to stow your earphones which is handy as it prevents it from tangling if kept just like that.
";Positive;-;-;-
"build quality does not feel premium. i feel the wires are delicate. sony earphones are better choice if you're looking for durable products. sound is well balanced, high and low are clear. vocals are clear. clarity in sound. but if you're an edm lover you might want to look at a different product because this earphone has sacrificed bass for clarity and balanced audio.

"i am using this earphone since oct 18. i saw many review about wire thickness but i didn't find any problem with that sound quality is good same as cx 213 overall good product. i don't know why senheiser used 6 year old model till now they should work on same pricing with good quality tongle free wire and good sound.

"excellent sound quality, excellent balance of bass and trebble. totally worth it. i have compared it with the sony one which comes around 1800 bucks and sony is no way nearer in terms the quality. i have compared it with the akg and it gave tough competition. but, sennheiser was little good. then i compared it with apple eaphones. in this apple earphones had better quality in sound.

"i love music with some bass. sennheiser cx 2.0g is good over all . nice soothing sound, comfortable, you can distinguish almost each cord and beat. but one thing it lacks bass, bass is just better than phone speaker. if you are not bass lover then its awesome earphone in 2k. i found wire may not sustain longer life and it's also not tangle free. thats a disappointment taking other earphones available in this range.

"for first few days i was really disappointed. the headphones sounded cheap. i actually thought to go for sony again. but after a week suddenly it started to sound great. bass is good and punchy but not at all overpowering. treble is fine. vocals are very very clear. well it is not comparable to my previous headphone ie sony mdr xb70.but it is good and very comfortable. surround sound is quite good and noise cancellation works ok, though i felt that the sound is tweaked in some places and certainly is not for a purist. but, overall at this price this is really a good headphone.
";Positive;-;-;-
"amazing sound quality, clear and punchy bass. good mids. and treble that doesn't bleed your ears! light to use and comfortable for prolonged use as well. low impedance, thus low power draw and loud volume. inline mic is good quality, for calls only tough! comes with a carrying pouch, do use it! it is not completely tangle free, but is fine.
";Positive;-;-;-
"usually plug type earphones don't give much bass which is standard for all brands not matter how big or small. i, however, was pleasantly surprised by the bass. i wasn't looking forward to it much while buying since i know plugs aren't effective bass wise. it's great. i also have another sennheiser, same-ish specifications but they aren't plugs, and this one does a 10% better job than that.ps: i'm a sennheiser lad so my review may be baised (or not). but they are just better than expensive sony (bass reflex) etc that i've used in the past.

"this is my 4th sennheiser product over the years and i really like its sound quality, not exactly as the premium sennheiser headphones which deliver a unique sound. this one is bassier. small, extremely light weight and a microphone that works well. although i feel its not durable due to the plasticky built but nothing happened so far.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"if what you want is quality sound with well differentiated mids and highs and a moderate amount of bass, not overpowering, but the right amount for a song as such. then get this. not for extra bass lovers. the fit is a little bit tricky to insert as well because of the unconventional shape of the headsets. but what matters is the sound quality, the latency is almost non existent on the microphone button, atleast on my phone anyway. no microphonics at all during normal usage and during walking. this is probably the only headset where i did not rely on the music player inbuilt equaliser to modify the sound signature. that speaks about the sound reproduction on the sennheiser headsets.

"first of all i wanted to say that sennheiser customer care service is awesome they just replace your product if it didn't have any physical damage., very rare company replace your defective product hand to hand in just 2 3 minutes.i think this cx275 s have some mic issue other people did complaint that your voice is not clear.

"noise reduction ?---------- a big yes. @ 1300 bucks in 'amazon lightning deals' which would otherwise be 2000 bucks at any other website, it was definitely a steal. 100% loud applause for amazon for making this real.product:- thumping basses + sizzling trebles.....nothing much out of proportion or distorted. i am not a technical buff nor have i done any course in musicology but i have had at least a dozen headsets from various makers in the past and can assure that this thing is a beast. again, don't always blame the hardware. the same song at 96 kbps and 320 kbps sound different through the same gadget. i cannot afford a bose but this thing is definitely way better than my native samsung/nokia headsets.

"i have been using this for almost 2 years now. i have tried so many earphones on the last 10 years.... but none come even close to the quality you get with this one. exceptional clarity and superb responsive in both low and high frequencies.each time you put it on, you can feel the difference.

"overall pretty good.complete noise cancellation is not expected at this price range anyway. but it does reduce some background noise.earbubs fit quite well. would not fall off during workout. build quality is also very nice.sound quality is very good at this price range although it lacks the punchy bass that some prefer.

"this item has been quite good. i have tried jbl, house of marley, sony and philips earphones, but this one leaves all competition behind. but of late, i am facing problems with the product. one side of the earphone is not working. since the product is still in the warranty period, i would like to know how to get this repaired/replaced. there is no email id/contact detail of cloudtail india private limited.

"as usual the sennheiser rocks. tried throwing different genre and it surpasses my expectation in all. after a lot of confusion between sony xb series and sennheiser cx series, i decided to go for sennheiser. this can become a perfect travel buddy cancelling all the surrounding noise.the package comes with steps to authenticate your earphone on official website. it is genuine. i also contacted sennheiser customer care just to do another round of review and they also confirmed the authenticity.i am deducting a star because the cable is very thin and you need to take extra care of this product to avoid cable damage (just my thought). it is also compatible with lumia, xperia, moto and iphone.again, its an amazing earphone below 2k.

"awesome sound quality! i love it :-)the box contains my cx275s, two extra earbuds (one large, one small pair), carry pouch.i just listened one song on this, would update more later.edit: they worked for 2 years straight on. this is really good. i purchased on 29 aug 2015 and only around oct 2017 it started having issues with one earphone not giving sound. it cost me rs.1791 for 2 years, that is rs. 2.4875 per day. any other rs. 500 earphone would have started giving issues in 6 months which would be costlier. the sound quality is really good. i am not a bass-head, i don't want my eaphones to boom base. i like music, and these are perfect. they don't focus on base. these earphones got pulled on many times, when i thought these would be done. they got twisted. it suffered through all that and didn't stop working. so it's durable.

"sennheiser has the best warranty in the market, they even replace the physically damaged piece in just five minutes(only bill is required). best sound quality is complemented by the amazing warranty(just they have only service centers in delhi and mumbai in india.). go for it,best value for money. writing this review after using these earphones for 2 years.

"awesommmmmmeeeeebought this from cloudtail, good quality and fast delivery. coming to the headphones, these are bassy. one of the best pairs i own till date. i have owned sony, samsung, htc, lenovo, beats and my previous best earphones the mi pistons 2.i used to think the piston had some good bass and clarity but after hearing the sennheiser cx275s, am just in aw. and the best part is that the performance is out of the box, the headphones will get better with play.you can hear individual bass beats and it sounds nice. also the mids are good(not best but still pretty nice). highs are also pretty nice.only con:the wires seem very fragile. too thin.mic seems ok quality. but you buy these cx for their sound quality so who cares about the mic

"the sennheiser cx275 s is an excellent earphone with very good sound quality. the brand is doing a justice for the sound clarity and the bass of any song provided. the only cons is that the wire quality is not so very strong and seems tangle very much which makes it quite delicate to handle when kept inside the pocket. since it is priced higher, the quality of the wire can be changed.otherwise, the earphones is a good buy.

"good bass though not top notch but at this price point it can't get better than this i suppose. sound quality at high and lows are good and there is no distortion. the carrying case provided with it is a nice. i got it for 1500 and it's worth the money.

"i am just loving listening sennheiser cx 275. every instruments of music/song is clear and distinct, base is there and it is as it should be, enough to enjoy without feeling hurt. it has proper and clear treble. lows, mid and high are all clear, constant and smooth. base is beautiful as it should be or as has been recorded in the studio and does not loose even on high. i am enjoying listening at every level of volume. under rs. 2000/-, the best bye !

"i have a collection of various headphones, but must say that this is ths the best headphone atleast in sub 2k price range.i regularly listen music in my moto g 1st gen, and i am quite serious about audio quality of the phone and the headsets. i, may not be an audiophile but can assure that this excellent headphone have the most balanced, precise audio output capabilities.headsets i have used-1) sony mdr ex 30 - too bass heavy, audio not clear, bulky2) creative ep630 - less bass, short wire, less warm sound3) nokia wh205 - very good audio output, slightly bassy, not crystal clear sound as sennheiser, wire don't tangles.4) cowon em1 - at par with nokia wh205. slightly midtone heavy5) soundmagic es18s - just bought cannot beat sennheiser, but 2nd best, good balance, not very loud, good cable, but gets tangled.6) sennheiser cx 275-pros- good balance between bass and treble, lows are clear and crisp, quite loud, very comfortable, excellent noise isolation, nice bagcons- slightly excess treble, mids not perfect, wires get tangled, cables are thin.there is hardly any headphone without any limitations, still i must say that this item satisfied my needs more than enough. i will purchase another one.

"so-so..... i was using xperia stock mh750 acia in ear that comes with z2. mh750 has a deeper bass. and i have sony mdr30 as well, although mdr30 suppress everything due to extra bass and it's not good but it has a mild treble which sooth my ear. anyway its upto people what they like.edit 2: after 5hr burn, bass feels good, but treble is a bit harsh still.

"i was confused between sony mdr xb30ex and these earphones. but i was getting sennheiser at rs.1300 in sale so i ordered them.looks : they look nicebuild quality:the wire is very thin but not fragile.still you have to be careful.sound: with edm songs you are doing in another world . for hip hop the base is just as much needed.they actually sound beautiful with every genre.lastly let me say under rs.2000 buying these pair will be your best decision.and for price i got rs.1300 i think i cannot be more lucky to own them.

"the cx275s is a really market worthy earphone. the bass is amazing, you can clearly feel the pounding of the beats. the vocals is crisp and clear and does not interfere with any other sounds. movies, songs, games, calls, radio all sound amazing.the noise cancellation is pretty amazing. i have had trouble with in-ear pieces on the apple or sony headsets, but this one fits extremely well. people now tap me to draw my attention, it's that good. the build looks fragile but is actually very sturdy.i got this product at a lightning deal during #freedomsale and the product arrived on time, so no complaints with amazon's delivery. however, the 3.5 mm connector that is provided with the box is a defective one. not sure if amazon or sennheiser will replace that as it's been more than a month now and i never registered a grievance on the same.

"the headphones are simply amazing considering the price of the product.pros: the highs/ mids/ lows are all very clear. each instrument and music effect sounds pretty amazing. bass is very impressive. in my oneplus one device i dont even need to use audio fx to boost any of the original sounds in a song. havent tried taking calls yet but m sure it will be good. noice reduction is pretty amazing even on low volumes.cons:to get perfect sound effects you need to raise the volume upto 30 %. the build quality seems to be flimsy, but am sure the 2 years warranty will take care of that. could have also added volume controls with mic and remote button for taking calls.

"the best headset in low range for pure music listening. i earlier had a sony regular headset which was complete in itself. the beats and bass of that one were better than any headset i have encountered.but after listening through this it took me to a whole new level of musical approach. the beats and music detail are so clear that even at lowest volume you can feel every single beat.the headset fitting in ears is awesome. you can listen to the songs for hours without hurting your ears.the noise reduction is perfect as even at low volumes you can experience all the fun.thebut be cautious as it is not for persons who love boombox type music. the overall bass is good but it isn't made for bass based music. so if you want bass go with sony or jbl but if you want beats, obviously this is the one.i am writing this review after 6 months of purchase and have not encountered a single problem with the product.

"serves the purpose. wanted something which is an all rounder and the cx275 s fits the bill perfectly. call clarity is good and the mic does its job well. for prolonged usage, i suggest changing the in ear buds to the smaller one (different sized buds come along with this model) as the ones from factory were slightly bigger than required for me.

"absolutely love this pair of ear buds. i needed something for my casual listening purpose while travelling, being on a budget these provided a great solution to that. at 1425 i couldn't have asked for a better deal. the best part is they are balanced, unlike most headphones on the market today that are just infused with meaningless bass. don't get me wrong, these deliver amazing bass as well, but it's all controlled and the way it's supposed to be. amazing sound spectrum and clarity. anything for casual listening and beyond, go for it!

"decent earphones. worth the price.1. call cut button works just fine2. the same button, double tap to move to next track while listening to songs.3. triple tap to move back to the previous track doesn't work. this worked with my sony stock earphones.4. sound quality is good.although these features don't work when u use the extension that comes along with this. i'm not sure why the extension is required.if you are looking for a decent set of earphones this one is the right one for you. if u are an ardent listener and a music fanatic there may be other better options out there for you.

"well, i have used a lot many earphones over the years starting from philips, sony to skullcandy etc etc of multiple ranges, be it below 500 or above 1500. but this particular product from sennheiser has just upped my listening to music experience by miles. simply one of the best of this range, and as an overall product also beats sony and skullcandy at its range. the music, the beats, the overall everything associated with a particular song feels even more vibrant now. i would suggest everyone and anyone looking forward to a decent earphone....go for this one. absolutely worth it.

"let me be very honest, i ordered the product on saturday night around 8:15 pm or so and received next day by 2:30 pm. the earphones are mind-blowingly amazing, far better than many headsets available at 2k-4k. sennheiser did an amazing job with each and every bit of the headsets. the ear cushions are very soft therefore you can wear those for many hours, coming to the sound quality the bass output is top notch. i recommend without giving a second thought go and buy it now!!!

"i received the earphones within a day thanks to amazing amazon delivery. i have used the headphones for 2-3 days and i am very impressed by its sound. sennheiser never disappoints when it comes to sound, i have another model mx-170 and i have been using it for last 5 years and it still gives that good sound as ever. this has got a more than average bass to it, and the sound clarity and all sounds which are overpowered by bass can be heard. mic also a big advantage, and its fits into the ear perfectly , no chance of falling out. there are multiple options depending upon ear size. the only bad thing is that it gets tangled very easily, and becomes a hassle to untangle.

"when i was looking for an ear phone with call facility, every one was suggesting samsung and other brands. at max they suggested to go for sony.i had an experience of sennheiser cx 180 and they were far better for listening training video than creative ep 630.i thought to give it a try and luckily i was successful. these ear phones are made to listen voice calls and perfect in listening music as well.guess what after me, two of my friends also bought the same ear phone for them.truly worthy for their features and their price, oops i forgot - you get two years warranty replacement

"most worthy in ear head phones. i am too glad to have them. although, i was not happy with the delivery boy, as i ordered the headphones at my office address expecting it to be delivered on weekdays, but it reached on sunday and delivery boy didn't agree to delivery it at my house lying in a radius of 500m. taking about headphones - the sound quality is best. even while driving on a busy road, a volume level of 40 is enough to give crystal clear sound with bass. for some, the price seems out of budget but trust me - tje quality is much more than expectations.

"its good. not awesome. i own cx180 already and i was happy with the sound quality of it.i bought this just because it is having mic support with smartphones.pros: good sound quality as always from senheiser, mic recording is beautiful, extension given and the pouch is given good enough to carry in your bag/purse.cons:not a tangle free wire, while placing the earphone in the ear we need to hold it at the tip. there is no kind of covering layer given at the joint of ear bud and wire connecting it so that we can hold it while placing it. (cx180 has a proper layer which gives enough support) , i would not recommend this while you have your helmets on the bike. a big no no. for those who are purchasing this for daily bike travel. as this tends to tangle alot and the fear is that without the holder i mentioned above it might cut it from the tip.

"i ordered these for my iphone 4 after a lot of research and reading thru all the reviews. original apple earphones set you back by 2.2 grand and i being a regular( read=over user) of the earphones, all of them invariably last for a maximum of 1 year. 2 grand every year is not a nice thing. i bought these and must say i love it. occasionally there are some minor issues with the volume when it increases all of a sudden marginally, nevertheless still love it. there is mic also which makes taking calls easier, however no volume buttons . you have to use the phone to reduce/increase the volume. all in all a great pair of earphones for 1.5 k and worth every penny. waits to be seen how long it lasts

"the sennheiser cx 275s is an earphone pair geared towards the bass lover on a modest budget. at rs. 1690, it's neither cheap nor over-priced, and offers solid, distortion-free audio performance. the boosted lows will scare away purists, and even bass fiends might find the highs, which are boosted and tweaked in peculiar spots, occasionally tinny or harsh. an inline remote control and microphone add value to the cx 275s, but the remote lacks volume controls, which is a bit of a bummer. overall, the cx 275s is a powerful pair with a lot to love,pros - powerful, distortion-free audio performance with deep, boosted lows. inline remote control and microphone for mobile devices. comfortable, secure, lightweight fit.cons - inline remote has no volume controls.

"best headset you can buy with in 2k, guys really i am saying its amazing, noise isolation job is fantasti. bass is not overwhelming, sharp and crisp sound. i used my z1 headsets iinitially, compared to that, this is far far far outstanding. sony is not worst but when it comes under competition, sennheiser wins. but u can feel chord is little thin when compared to other, but performance is thundering.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"when i ordered it i was like.. its sennheiser and it'll be cool and sound would be cool. but when i used it for first time they turned out to be awesome. they fit into ears just perfectly, bass is truly great and the mic is really fantabulousit truly reduces the outside noises, music is clear and you can hear those beats clearly which you would have missed other wisethis headset might not be the best, but for the money you pay its as best as it can get

"good headphone for normal use, treble a little high but can be adjusted using equaliser. in the ear experience is awesome also over the experience is also very good. it has a little lesser range of bluetooth though, signal interupts over closed doors. output is not very loud but generally ok. most importantly being a sports range headphone it is not waterproof, mine got damaged due to sweating in gym. asked for replacement from ccare but no reply since 15 days.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"great productexcellent sound quality and mic is also quite clear for the receiver. i did see some comments around the range not being good, but i tested it in a range of approx 20 to 30 feets - through concrete walls are didn't find any issues.i do miss a mute function for the mic which would have made this more than perfect. i might be missing a trick here, but if anyone knows if there is a way to mute the mic without muting from the phone or laptop would be interested to know
";Positive;-;-;-
"valure for money, was a bit worried but the sound clarity turned out to be really good and very portable, i haven't used it for a long time so cant talk about that, but its overall a really good wireless earphones unlike the bulky one's in the market. go for it if ur tired of wire earphones.

"these are amazing earphones for the price. i have bose wired earphones, i was looking for wireless earphones for gym and these fit my ear just fine. love sound and bass. it's not bass heavy. still it's loud enough. one more thing if anything comes between source and these earphones music will break. i knew this before buying so not an issue for me.

"treble and bass are great.. but clarity is not up to mark.. i pared it with a note 5 and the sound quality was not like a wired headphone like sony xtra bass or any other good skullcandy... overall satisfied because i have used a level u b4.. this is much better than that...!!

"of course i am big fan of skullcandy but these are the best among all the others i own. sound is subpar the skullcandy. for those who tangle free music experience these are really good. all those bass lovers these are must to get.i love the neck band it has this blue led which gives really good effect for my workout videos.even in gym when surrounded by loud music these work flawlessly.pretty rough usable. battery is good i was able to use upto 8hours without hearing that annoying beep.all in all for the amount the product is best.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"i have been using this headphones for a week now and i have never seen or heard a much more beautiful elegant earphones at all. the best in bass and crisp raspy sound. people say that the neck band is slightly discomforting.. but i'd say no.. i wore them seeing 2 good movies back to back and i did not feel discomforting at all. makes u feel as if this is not there on your ears and neck at all.pros1)perfect fit on the ears2)very light weight compared to other wireless earphones on market3)good bass4)amazing design and the neck bands do come out and go in very easily5)very very quick and easy pairing for my one plus phone. btw it supports dual pairing.6)call connection is good and it my voice is very clearly audible for the other person while on phone. mic is good.cons1)battery life isn't more than 6 hours as i fully charged the earphone and watched 2 movies back to back which was around 6.5 hours and it beeped for low battery.2) the earphones without the neck bands may be a little and i mean slightly little issue as they tend to slide back off the neck. if the beck bands are attached, it stays put.3) no one touch siri or google now which is the only thing i did not like as i am a great fan of those. while driving if u want to call someone then u have got to remove your phone and dial which is sometimes irritating as i feel.on the whole this is a beautiful piece of device for 60$ or 3200 inr. please go for it as it's perfect for good listening with good bass and very comfortable for long hours of gym and musichope you like my reviews and thanks for reading them.

"a gud earphones under bluetooth list..great bass and sound even outdoors. the nly prblm is dat the sound misses or cuts for a micro second many times when the phone is in the pocket and u r like walking or running....except dat its a beast....btw can dis be fixed?? if yes den i will give 5 stars.,.....

"bought this product on amazon sale for rs 2634/-great product. worth buy, very comfortable and light weight to use.build quality is best (as you all know about skullcandy products - quality at its best).using it from 2 weeks now. for music and call on an average, i use it for 4-5 hrs a day and till now i have charged the headset only twice.charge speed is also good as it doesn't take more than an hour to charge.if you are looking for wireless headset, i would suggest to go with this.

";Positive;-;-;-
"got it in a deal for 1899/- and here are my thoughts.1. connectivity and range: very good. it powers on fast and pair easily & quickly, and i can even walk between rooms without any loss in signal or quality.2. sound: decidedly average. it is definitely boosted, so if you do like punchy bass and are not particular about texture or accuracy, no problems. sound better than almost anything that comes packaged with a smartphone. distortion creeps in at 65%+ volume3. usability: they fit snugly, and isolate just enough so you can hear your music well but also know what's going on in traffic around you.4. calls: under normal circumstances these are fine. person on the other side had some problem hearing me when i've used these while cycling.5. battery: good. i use them for about 2-3 hours a day and charge them every 3 days. they charge in a couple of hours and are good to go. battery lasts for around 5-6hours on an average.overall: easy to recommend if you're only looking for an upgrade to generic earbuds and want to try wireless. battery life and connectivity are great so no issues there. however, if you're primarily looking for a good listening experience, i'd say pass on this one.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"awesome earphones. good built quality. good sound quality. trustful brand. good mix function. it takes less than 2 hours to charge actually. worthy for this price.all the negatives comments out there are dependent on the way they use this product.overall i love it.
";Positive;-;-;-
"software :the sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.the bass is very good. perfect for edm lovers.the connection range does not extend to another room.rarely, there are problems with connecting to the device, not a red flag.hardware:the device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides about, may be a red flag for certain users.the magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.noise cancellation works very well.battery life is somewhat poor. the output of a fully charged device is less than 6 hours.can't say much about durability now as it hasn't been long since i bought it. all i can say is, jbl has much better durability than skullcandy.overall:for its price, it's a catch.
";Positive;-;-;-
"got them for about 2k, and have been using more than a couple of hours each day. definitely worth the price.sound quality: average, but that means it doesn't do anything terribly. the bass isn't as punchy, and the treble could have been more defined. but, there is no noise, so the mids come through clearly (perfect for my choice of music). the volume is a bit lower than wired earphones, but there is no distortion at peak volumes, not that it should be used at those. you could get wired earphones with similar sound quality at abt 1k, so that makes sense, considering that they need to charge for bluetooth hardware.battery life: now, this could be done better. either the should have given a larger battery, or had better battery management software. it doesn't turn off if it is paired, but not used for an extended period. so, you have to make sure that you switch it off manually. lasts about 4-5 hrs on less than 50% volume.durability: uses flat wires, and the built ""seems"" sturdy. definitely better than my sennheiser earphones.other features: call quality is decent enough. mic is not that great, need to be pulled closer for decent performance unless you want to speak up a bit. buttons are decent, and work without fail. there is a bright led on the control capsule, lets people know you can't hear them. wire is a bit too long, could've been a couple of inches shorter each side, but the balance is good. fit snugly in your ear, doesn't fall out. the earphones bundle up nicely, and take practically no space in your pocket.overall, given the price, meets my expectations. wasn't expecting them to match something worth 6k or more, but doesn't disappoint for the money i spent.
";Negative;-;-;-
"a great buy except that you will not get google assistant or siri support. good for bike use too. not for runners . good for gym. best for bollywood music. as usual jbl sound. must buy if you are into bollywood or general youtube and calls user. calls are also awesome over this headset.

"i m a bass lover and reading the reviews i was confused to purchase it or not but i trusted jbl brand and purchased it.sound quality is good. bass is sufficient to feel the vibrations and thump. you can purchase this without any 2nd thought
";Neutral;-;-;-
"sound quality is excellent, connect it any phone you will get the same range of output.. connected to my old honor 4c which has worst earphone output in that phone i was getting best sound output on this jblt110bt... talking about the battery it depends on your usage, if you use it continuesly without switching off it would last upto 6 hours... if you use it time by time and turn off in between the running time wouldn't more than 5 hrs. ..the one thing i didn't like about is the length of the cable.. it bit longer for no use and it doesn't fit on your neck for no reason... but still we can compromise that.it would give 4.5 star out of 5..

"writing this review after a year and a half of really rough usage.i have been taking this headphone where ever i go it survived falling down on roads and in the rain ,i have to tell i am really impressed with the build quality and the price was really reasonable.after one year of thrashing and rough usage it finally gave in this week even the charge lasted much longer than usual and charging time was also really less.i would recommend this to anyone due to its superb build quality and long lasting battery.coming to the sound quality i would give it 5 stars as being a frequent traveler i have no issues and the bluetooth connectivity is also fast.i wear this earphones inside my helmet and am still able to hear anything without any problem around traffic.

"bought the product despite some reviews i saw on amazon that the headphones doesn't produce bass.for me, the product is a good one. have true pure bass, but only when it is inserted deeply into the ear channel. when the ear plugs are simply kept into the ears, you could hear only treble and no bass.overall a good product.

"thanks to amazon.good sound quality.bass and treble are well balanced. perfect sound quality. best ever i have heard till now. even better than sony, which lacks in crystal sound due to overpowered bass.battery would have been better. but, the battery does not often charge due to some loose connection in the charging unit. i have to drop the full set on the floor thrice, so that the battery regains its charging capacity again.

"as usual, there are some connectivity issues. the volume controller's placement is really bad. but it delivers a very good experience. bass and treble are perfectly balanced. midtones and vocals are clear. most importantly i can use this earphone while riding a 2 wheeler with my helmet on. araaam see...

"awesome product. battery backup is about 5 1/2 - 6 hours when i am using it continuously. have been using it for more than 3 months. no issues faced. if your usage is within 5 - 6 hours at a time my suggestion go for it. voice is clear when speaking, lightweight. bass & sound quality is great but does depend on the app you are using in your phone to listen to music. i have tried with jio music, amazon music, jet player etc. most of the players gave excellent output. i guggest try with different players or equalizer settings to get the perfect audio. the wires are tapered in shape hence can sustain a little bit of stress. 3 different size of earbuds are available with this product and selecting the correct size does not allow the buds to fall off (tried it when running on a treadmill). all in all awesome product at this price.
";Positive;-;-;-
"after a long research to get my bt headset in the price rage of rs.2000, i finally landed with this one. i'm happy about this choice. i explored ant, tagg and other brands but the jbl brand value and its wider service network given confidence. surely it's simple yet powerful headphone. very elegant design, no non-sense outfit. perfect for several hours of music. it is having magnetic lock, which is not mentioned in the product page. in the pack, it has different sized three pairs of ear-bud caps, the subtle orange in the ear-buds presents its beauty very presently. as far as sound concern, it is jbl. i already own speaker and over-head phone from jbl, which are performing for several years consistently. this also proves its quality. good bass and clarity, even in minimum to maximum volumes. if you have high resolution audio files, it is perfect companion. the mic placement is not friendly and no carrying pouch is given so, i deduct one star for it.
";Positive;-;-;-
"sound quality is very clear and good but base is normal.battery life is good and noise cancellation is exillent.
";Positive;-;-;-
"the earphones are decent to listen music. to receive calls, the voice echoes. more so,the length of the chord could have been a little shorter as it's length is a little bigger for a bluetooth earpiece. rest, noise cancellation is good. and thanks amazon for timely delivery .
";Neutral;-;-;Neutral
"in ?2000 price range its a fair purchase. the sound quality though is not that up to mark, at least not what i expect from jbl. its not pure bass as it says its just a lot of treble and i hate it. overall its ok just turn on the eq and change it to bass booster but it will lower the volume a little and you can hear the outside world clearly. the design is neat and very attractive but the placement of the mic is not a suitable position. the bluetooth sometimes disconnects when multitasking. i faced this problem while i was playing pubg and suddenly someone called when i picked up the phone it disconnected that is very annoying every time as you have to go through the bluetooth settings to reconnect. rest its all right. afterall we should not forget we are getting all that in ?2000. so that’s quite okay. its not a compromise its a good purchase.
";Positive;Positive;-;-
"quality of product is good for this range of money. sound quality is good, bass is ok as it's mention as pure bass. little bit unsatisfied due to not having waterproof, carrying case and deep bass as compare to boat rockerz 250 waterproof for this range of cost. over all product is more than average. and received in good condition.
";Positive;-;-;Positive
"amazing sound quality but apple earpods weigh in with a better sound clarity! anyways great quality

";Positive;-;-;Neutral
"the sound is good.bass is good but treble is also high.i got it replaced the earlier product didn't have bass to it but the replaced headphone is good.call quality is on average side but i didn't buy it for that so no issue for me.if anyone get headphone with more treble than base just replace it.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"i was using this for 2months sound quality is good not that great but at this price tag ok .if jbl makes more bass of this that would be great.in terms build quality is superb. i recommend this for work outs who travel a lot.

"got this for someone else who uses them for about 6 hours a day and then complains about battery life not being that great! 5-6 hours is sufficient i think for a product this size.i think it does the job, is easy to pair, comfortable around the neck as well as on the ears but maybe - just maybe the battery could have some more juice - maybe.
";Neutral;-;-;-
"this is the perfect wireless earphone for any music lover. after going through a lot of earphons and headphones by jbl, have to say, they have not left me down. only problems are that the magnets are on the sides which makes them a bit confusing and carrying case is not provided. letting that go, this is the real deal. good music quality and build.(been using for a week). hope this review was helpful.

"output nice and loud. connectivity feedback sound is great. bass not impactful or as great as sony or skullcandy. but considering price, it is good. ear buds tip has dual color which is attractive. branding missing on back side of ear buds. easy to pair with all devices, i tried with tv and mobile. it keeps background noise outside only. product quality and build is good.

"one of the best in it's category. easy to connect. very good bass and clarity of sound.mic works just fine. hassle free and easy to use too. the battery backup is par not bad but could be better and else everything is good.

"this is the best bluetooth headphone i've found in this price range and this has come new in the market recently. specially the magnet ting in the ear pieces are awesome, it's the most helpful thing.in the box it says ""pure bass"", bass is not that high but audio clarity with effects is really good. while listening to some tracks i feel that treble is little high but that i've solved by using equalizer on my phone. it took me about 1 hr 40 mins to charge and goes on full day well.the wire which is at the rear (neck area) should've been a little longer and front ones a little short because it's sometimes difficult to find the buttons for changing songs or picking up the call.but overall according to my experience jbl is always the best. no matter what product you buy from them their music quality is always the best.
";Positive;-;-;-
"didn't last for even 3 months. was very happy with the product initially but as all the other reviewers have mentioned, the battery is worst. the battery life reduced slowly from 6 hours to now 2 minutes.really was not expecting this from a jbl product.lost trust on the jbl brand

"i got it for 1900 and believe me you can't get any better bluetooth earphone on this budget... noise cancellation is great, before reaching top volume your ambience will be mute doesn't matter how much noise is there... sound quality is great in a quite place you can't listen to top volume (if you're not a hard core metallica fan, for them no headphone has enough sound). the bass is the main highlight of this earphone, you can enjoy every beat of music. great pricing from jbl. highly satisfied... 5/5 points...
";Positive;-;-;-

"this device here received a tons of negativity on amazon and other sites but just a quick note that when we shift from wired to wireless the sound quality really affects so if we have to compare we should do it with other wireless earphones not the wired one .the sound quality is nice, not crystal clear but good enough.the bass is good. perfect for edm lovers electronic dance music.the connection range is amazing .it's really easy to connect to new deviceson the physical overview, it has got a really big neckband which is kind of annoying most of the times and it has 3 buttons - one to play and pause music or receive call or end and the other two to change the music as well as to change volume, depending the time u press those keyswhen we talk about the looks of the device it looks good if you are wearing a shirt or a t-shirt with a collar so u can hide the neck ban in the collar if not then it's uncomfortable and also looks awkward at the same timeat a price point of 2000rs and jbl branding it is a fair pricetime for the big deal the pros and conspros;noise cancellation works very well.battery life is good. the output of a fully charged device is around 6-8 hours depending on the volumebuild quality is amazingcons:the device does not sit perfectly on your shoulder, it slides aboutthe magnets that are supposed to hold the earbuds together are very weak and keep disconnecting.bass is not much as jbl devices are known for high bassthis is a great device but the wireless earphones lacks in either sound/battery/looks/comfort and this one lacks in comfort

"after having troubled with other bts. fortunately found an earphone which supasses my expectations giving the price brand. and look its from jbl. what else do want?superb sound, bass quality is good. sound is perfect. either go for it or increase your wallet expense.they don't provide any pouch for carrying it but that should not discourage you from buying it.
";Positive;-;-;-
"the quality of the product is good enough for the amount you are paying!i have been using the jbl t290 wired ones before these and when compared with tht one you are lacking a bit of bass on this bluetooth earphone but still it is highly recommended for the price you are payingadjusting the bass in the system equaliser helped me a bit

"not sure why there are so many negative reviews, these earphones are great. have been using them daily for about 3 hours a day for the last 4 months and they are close to perfect.i use audio technica m50x for listening to music for the most part. bought these jbl bluetooth ones for use where the m50x is too bully to carry.pros:charge lasts about 5 hours.lightweight.produces very clear sound.bluetooth range is quite high, at least 15 metres in my experience.cons:slightly more expensive than i'd have liked, i paid 2250...microphone is placed near your shoulder so taking calls can be a little irritating. people keep telling me i sound like i'm far away.

";Positive;-;-;-

"i was hesitant of buying this product as there were no reviews when i bought this product.but once i got the product i feel i made the right choice.it's not a fancy product but does the job well for listening music and receiving phone calls. easy to operate and easy to setup. would recommend anyone looking of wireless headset in this price range
";Neutral;-;-;-
"i am using this device 10 month i am not found any problem with this earphone jbl is a trustable brand. quality is best with this price range i bought 1980 rs. only and also extend warranty 2 year of only 399 rs.most dissappointing thing is that its battery its drain of approxx. 4:30 -6:00 hour in videos but in call and its last long upto 5-7 hour when it disscharge it contain charging upto 1:30-2:00 hour.
";Positive;-;-;-
"first of all let me tell you that it's a bluetooth headset so please don't compare it with wired headphones, even if you buy the most expensive bluetooth product you won't get the sound quality as good as wired headphones due to bandwidth limitations, considering the same i would suggest to go for it if you want to use it while jogging or workout, may not be good for the people who want to use it only for music
";Neutral;-;-;-
